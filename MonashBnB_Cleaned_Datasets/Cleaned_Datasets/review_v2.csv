     Great Beach and amazing cafes/ restaurants around the corner from Raewyns pad. We especially enjoye (Website hidden by Airbnb) Tommy Ruffs-Amazing fish tacos and fish and chips...house made iced tea was really yummy!!!Always crowded, be prepared to wait for a delicious meal.
     We also Loved YOMG, Great Grass Fed beef burgers, Chicken sandwiches, yummy frozen yoghurt to die for!!!
   Raewyns place has everything you can think of, her continental breakfast is really a generous offer-her kitchen is well appointed!! We slept comfortably for 9 nights!!! We Loved our talks with Raewyn about many things, She really made our stay comfortable and memorable!!
Jasper, Raewyn‚Äôs cat is just so adorable and Lovable- it was hard to say goodbye!!
The whole ground level was ours, we felt very much that we had our privacy, and since Raewyn has a very active lifestyle, she is gone for a good part of the day most days, seems as if we had the whole place to ourselves a lot!!
Definitely recommend to anyone wanting  to visit this area, the beach life is #1."

The room is comfortable and clean. Thanks for the prompt directions. One suggestion for the direction:after arriving at Southern Cross station, the free hotel transfer service covers the Milano Apartments. I was wondering around for a while trying to get the right bus or tram to  your place until getting your further advices.

Regards Alex"

Melbourne is a city that has a very good sense of design, the same as Mia's (Website hidden by Airbnb) quite a cool place to stay, dark style interior, good taste decoration and  graceful staff. When we came back after wandering outside a whole day, we felt like going home.
It's our first time spending Chinese new year in a foreign country, Mia's place impressed us most. Some say hi, some say bye, maybe we will come back again. Best wishes to Mia!"

75109,67024319,2016-03-26,2134737,Aaron,100,"I had a wonderful stay in Melbourne with Karen, Jim and their family and friends.  Karen welcomed me to a clean, comfortable room with lots of lights and two fresh towels (after three months backpacking a real towel is such a luxury!).  They were very courteous to my schedule  and my coming and going, and allowing free use of the kitchen, porch and living room as I pleased... I was free to be as integrated with their home, or apart from it, as I liked which is a wonderful way to treat a visitor.  As described, the house is in one of the more quiet suburbs of Melbourne but getting downtown is a short walk to the train station and a short trip to Flinders, CBD and the rest of the city.  I highly recommend."

51592,1248581,2012-05-08,146258,Abbey,100,"michelle's place is absolutely stunning!! i cant say a single bad thing about it. there are so many tiny little things that add to all the grand aspects. like seeing a huge city clock from outside one of the windows, the swing in the center of the room, the shower head that feels like heavy rain. What was especially great is how quite it is even on weekend. you cant hear a thing of whats going on in the city streets. the bed is like a cloud. Michelle was so flexible with picking up the keys and check in and check out times. She was quickly responsive and lovely to communicate with. The best experience vie had through airbnb to date.  "

A short walk to the beach and an excellent kids adventure playground just round the corner.

313648,123824300,2016-12-30,26449448,Abdullah,96,"We were visiting Melbourne for the Boxing Day Test Match and found it to be the perfect location (it is only a few minutes walk to the MCG). The famed Fitzroy Gardens are also a stone's throw away. Public transport is very near and you can commute to and from the city with very ease.

The apartment itself is nicely kept and very sufficient. Haydn was a very good host and ensured that we had no issues during our stay. Haydn was also kind enough to show us the neighborhood and take us to the nearest shopping center when we first arrived. Would recommend the place for people who want to be close to the CBD while staying in a suburb with a lot of character and culture."

38271,121921388,2016-12-19,71086234,Abhilash,96,A good place for families to stay . Loved the pin board where we can pin down the place we come from . Individual bedrooms with comfortable beds is one of the biggest boon.  Lack of an induction stove is a slight setback. Extremely friendly host with an amazing house makes this place a lovely place to stay with family .

The apartment is conveniently located near the tram stop and Richmond itself has lots of cafes, restaurants and pubs if you don't want to venture far in the evening. We had full days sightseeing and it was brilliant to come back to a homely flat for a chat - and the bed is amazingly comfy! We would really recommend staying with them if you're in Melbourne!"

It is just lovely, the vintage feel was awesome and we felt very much at home which was whats important. Coming home everyday from a long day out was like coming home to my own house coz it was that cozy and homey. The place is so near everything, literally a few steps away from the tram stops, cafes, restos and shops!! You wont get (Email hidden by Airbnb) munication was very quick and easy between me and Loren and i felt comfortable already even if we hadn't met yet.  It was nice meeting Ruth although it was quick but definitely would love to meet Loren on our next trip which i can assure you it is where we would stay again! Many many thanks again!"
307630,1031178,2012-03-22,1599333,Abigail,99,"My husband and I relocated to Melbourne in late February and decided to stay with Sharyn for our first month in the city.  I cannot state emphatically enough how pleased I am we decided to do so!  Sharyn is the ideal host: She has tremendous knowledge about the city, is very outgoing and friendly and she is always good for a laugh :)  That said, we also had enough personal space that Hayward Ln really felt like a home for the time we were there.  Be it setting up a mobile or bank account or finding a house to rent, Sharyn was an invaluable resource in our move to Melbourne.

So that's for the host, now on to the flat:  The apartment is HUGE for Melbourne City standards and has very unique character and feel.  The rooms are good sized, with plenty of room for two people even if you are traveling with an inordinate amount of luggage.  The building itself is not brand new, so if you are looking for something immaculate and cookie-cutter, this is probably not the place for you.  Last but not least, location location location!  The apartment is quite literally in the middle of it all; easy walk to just about anywhere and surrounded by heaps of public transit if you dislike the shoelace express.  

To anyone looking for unique, comfortable and secure lodging in the heart of the city - with a bad ass hostess to boot - then Hayward Ln is the place for you!  Happy trails :)"

The directions she provided were extremely thoughtful and clearly written for someone who had no knowledge of Melbourne's layout and transit system (very much appreciated!), and she took the care to leave comprehensive notes to preempt any questions I might have about the place.  On top of going above and beyond in her hosting duties, Loren's home is absolutely gorgeous and was a delight to have had as a homebase during my trip ‚Äì I contemplated cancelling future travel plans and moving in!"

Since it's the first time I came to Melbourne, living alone and study alone, Lizzy and Allen helped me a lot. They are so nice , just like my friends, family during this long period of time. Besides, this cozy and quiet house has everything you need, with a beautiful garden, which is really the best for travelling or studying. The location is pretty convenient, you can take 693/742 to Oakleigh Station/Chadstone/Monash Uni, and IGA just within 1-2 minutes walk. A fantasic living for over two months, studying in the private house and enjoying the BBQ on the deck. I'm so glad to meet with Lizzy and Allen and wish to see you again~"

161033,13112477,2014-05-19,15294954,Adam,96,Everything about our stay in this cabin was perfect. Highly recommended.
244952,184497007,2017-08-20,731293,Adam,100,Great apartment. Like a little oasis in the middle of town.
263871,6937478,2013-08-31,2984223,Adam,100,"I stayed in this apartment for the month of August. It's very nice - quite, clean, large, well decorated. I thought it was nicer than the pictures suggested. Everything you might need (towels, an iron, etc) is in the apartment. The location is extremely central, and there are some decent cafes and restaurants within a couple of blocks. There was a problem with the wifi in the last week I was in the apartment and it was never resolved, but Eliisa did try hard to help. She's easy to communicate with generally. "
76867,260763711,2018-05-05,4366391,Adam,100,"Judy's place has all necessary basic comforts for a good sound inexpensive hotel stay in Melbourne, with the huge added bonus of having Judy and her big conviviality included. She is a genuinely thoughtful and sanguine person, and for this guest it was a pleasure to connect with her, and have someone to bounce ideas off. The apartment is in the hub of South Melbourne, which I appreciated as I wanted to really be a tourist and checked out the NGV, ACMI, theatres, ferry trips on the Yarra River, etc. And getting a good well priced lunch was really easy just moments from Judy's place. 
I wouldn't hesitate to recommend Judy and her room as a host, or to use her facilities again myself."
268849,39058956,2015-07-20,35934166,Adam,100,"Mia's apartment is great and was well above expectations. 
Lot's of thought and love given to the space, and Mia was more than welcoming. Couldn't more highly recommend.  "
363278,35035957,2015-06-14,9626460,Adam,89,"My stay at Alan's on the weekend was my first Air Bnb experience and I couldn't have been happier with it. The house is in a great central location in Fitzroy but tucked away in a secluded street. If you weren't looking, you wouldn't see it. So it's central but peaceful. I awoke my first morning to Alan's homemade bread, a pot of tea, a warm fireplace and Jack dog and Meg cat. Jack is a beautiful creature you'll want to take home with you.
The  host is friendly, kind and respectful. And generous. Alan offered to, and did drive me to Hawthorne to a conference I was attending.
The house is immaculately kept, oozing charm and very, very warm.
If you're flying solo this is the shot. It beats returning an empty hotel room anyday and will save you a few bucks too. Alan was also very flexible with check out time the next day. I got the impression I was welcome as long  I liked. Thanks Alan."

We were only there for 24hours so really only needed a bed. Room and bathroom were sufficient.
A pity about the construction site literally out the window, lucky we were so tired that we were able to sleep through the jack-hammering!

Thanks,
Adam"
363278,57065263,2015-12-21,9548160,Adam,96,Staying with Alan was a joy.  Very helpful and great to have a chat with.
283257,68699404,2016-04-06,24558434,Adam,95,"The apartment was fantastic! As well as being clean and spacious, it had a kitchen full of utensils and our hosts had very kindly prepared a sort of 'welcome basket' with the essentials. There are two bathrooms, one essentially an en suite to the main bedroom upstairs. Our hosts Lulu and Michael couldn't have been more helpful. The location means that the main shopping streets of Fitzroy are barely a 5 minute walk away: you'll find lots of cafes and shops, and at night it comes alive with bars. The main Melbourne CBD is only 15-20mins away by tram."
315513,104992634,2016-09-29,92425632,Adam,90,"We had a brilliant week there, the hosts were amazing and the house was beautiful. Couldn't fault anything with our stay and would recommend it to anyone.  We would 100% stay there again"
244952,103487063,2016-09-22,34493527,Adam,90,"We needed a place to use as a temporary base to find permanent accommodation and the Treehouse met our needs. Close to CBD. Close to friends we know. Close to various trams and bus options for getting out and about to the CBD and other suburbs. Fitzroy's a good location for bars and cafes to suit most tastes and the apartment's super close to the lovely Carlton Gardens park.

The accommodation itself is quiet and bright, has everything you'd expect and the bed was super comfy which is awesome and rare outside of hotels."
244952,3723062,2013-03-08,2426101,Adam,0,"We spent a lovely few days at Rebecca's apartment. The location is perfect, nice and close to the action, but far enough away for peace and quiet at night. Rebecca was overseas during our booking, but communication was swift and easy. Rebecca allowed us to leave our bags at the apartment after check-out and pick them up later which was a big help. The bed is nice and comfortable and I'm surprised no-one has mentioned the wonderful shower. The water pressure was incredible. I'll miss this the most. I'd go for Argo Loves Company over Slowpoke for coffee down the road. Labor in Vain is a great little unpretentious pub for a quiet drink and some some cool tunes, just round the corner. My only gripe would be that the apartment was very hot and stuffy. Rebecca supplied a fan, but it didn't really cut it. Luckily we only used the apartment to sleep. We were out all the time. This may be of concern if you were looking at a long stay in summer.

I'll certainly be looking forward to returning to Rebecca's treehouse on my next visit to Melbourne."
241263,351432828,2018-11-22,14622560,Adam,98,"Wonderful place, amazing location, and Gloria is a positively warm and welcoming host. Would stay again in a heartbeat! Thank you Gloria!"

307630,3643868,2013-02-26,1095587,Adam & Rob,100,Great central location and perfect for our needs for one night in Melbourne. Sharon was very welcoming and accommodating.

10803,472107310,2019-06-19,45038845,Adele,93,Lindsay's place is conveniently situated very near a main tram-stop. The tram-ride into the CBD is around half-an-hour and once in the CBD the tram conveniently passes Southern Cross train Station.  Close to the accommodation there is a cafe or two and a pub. There is also a flight of stairs up to the accommodation so this could be a bit awkward for some.
80986,613924,2011-10-10,948965,Adeline,0,"Frank and Vince are born to host. Before we arrived, they answered all our queries promptly and patiently. After we arrived, Frank and Vince were super nice. They lugged our baby elephant luggages up three flights of steps, and kindly gave us late checkouts too. Their apartment is stylish, cosy, clean and well stocked with towels, utensils... all of life's essentials... What's more, the location is superb. Surrounded by lots of green, interesting streets and cafes. I'm grateful for the experience and would definitely stay with Frank and Vince again. "
47100,698663,2011-11-07,271255,Adeline,98,"Loren's place was like a gallery. Her pieces there unique and everything just compliment each other. It was very cosy with the orange lightings. We had a very comfortable stay. You have access to the tram. It takes 20 minutes or so to the CBD where there is train station. My cousin and I did not have a chance to meet Loren in person. However, this did not hinder the check-in and check-out. She is very fast in responding our texts and emails. =)"
310594,3692709,2013-03-04,1643179,Adeola,99,We would thoroughly recommend a stay at the Treehouse. It close to some great cafes and restaurants and it has great transport links near by. Bridget was really accommodating and flexible with check in/check out times which was a great help. The actual house was as great as the photos. We would stay there again the   next time we are in Melbourne.

Her apartment is stunning and located in a leafy and green part of Melbourne. The room itself is warm and immaculately clean. The bathroom is hotel spec. The best part is the living space with their stunning views. Gloria is a relaxed, caring and funny lady who we got on really well with. Her cat Binoche is the feline king of Melbourne and a cat that we will miss. Super affectionate and always up for a belly scratch ( Binoche not Gloria)! 
I would recommend this place to anyone and we hope to stay again one day."

244952,2733171,2012-10-27,271405,Adrienne,96,"Hi There -
I highly recommend Rebecca's little pad. It's very comfortable and has amazing sunlight and a beautiful tree outside near the little balcony. It's super convenient to Brusnwick Street while still being quiet and a little removed. It's close to the 112 and the 96 trams, which tend to take one anywhere you want to go for at least an initial stay in Melbourne. Having easy laundry on site ('across the hall') was a surprisingly helpful addition. And she is lovely and very helpful. "
108032,417065797,2019-02-25,1645324,Adrienne,0,"Malcolm's place was one of the best AirBnB experiences we have ever had.  This stylish, welcoming apartment is located in the center of the city.  The bed and the pillows were fabulous. (Better than the bed in my home!)  Melbourne is an exciting city that reminded us of New York City with terrific clothing shops, art galleries, wonderful coffee bars, sidewalk cafes and restaurants with food from all parts of Asia.  (You can also find some great Italian and Greek food if that's your pleasure.)  Your artistic experience begins in Malcolm's flat with interesting artwork and wonderful books.  Malcolm was the best host!  Coffee, fruits, milk, juice, wine and some other breakfast provisions awaited us.  Melbourne is a must-see destination in the world!  Thank you so much Malcolm for your hospitality and kindness!"

I had some plans unexpectedly fall through and Dee and Daryl were right there to step in and assist me. Dee kept me occupied with various activities and Daryl assisted me with selling some tickets I could no longer use. As always, they were welcoming and gracious hosts, the apartment was spotless and the fridge was stocked with various goodies. I could not ask for better hosts! They are the epitome of Aussie hospitality."

The accommodation is  very homely and has everything we need, especially the kitchen which is very well stocked. We cooked our meals a lot during the two weeks stay because we love the kitchen. The hosts Frank and Vince are very prompt in answering all our questions and have our minor problems fixed in no time. This place is extremely good value for money."

What I can add is :to me Alan is  a very  beautiful soul ,absolutely amazing person with a huge heart .
He deserves to be treated with respect ,kindness and l love.
No other way .  
He is the kind of person who will share with you last bit of water on the dessert !

78143,98164350,2016-08-29,60363300,Aimy,99,Great place - two separate rooms with comfy beds and a big guest-only washroom. Breakfast was included with the basics. Julie was a charming host with lots of advice for what to see and do in Melbourne. It's a 5-minute walk to Chapel St (lots of restaurants) and a 5-minute walk to the train station to catch a train into town. Perfect location. Only thing to note is no Wifi at the house. But plenty of coffee shops on Chapel St with free Wifi open late. 
47100,341829,2011-06-29,357114,Aini,95,Loren and Ru are super lovely persons. I am very pleased with whatever they offered me (the best tips for tourist and nice flat while I am in Melbourne).

He epitomizes hospitality, amiability and is a gentle soul. Apart from having a great place, with a great view and location, it's Mario that makes the place and my first AirBnb experience a memorable one.

He goes out of his way to accommodate you and makes sure you feel right at home.

Even though I was in Melbourne, three days before I checked in to his place, I felt like I had already met him. He texted to see how I was doing and if I needed any help. He also so kindly booked tours such as the great ocean road and the Phillips island tour for me :)

My biggest regret is that I didn't get to spend much time with this amazing chap! Even though we grabbed lunch or a quick bite on the last day, will definitely come back to Melbourne and grab a cold one with him. 

He even texted me when I got to Sydney to see if I was ok or needed his help. I feel sorry for the other air bnb home owners, for he has set the yardstick way too high "

The local residents, Possums could be heard on the roof in the late evening but don't let that put you off. This is about staying in Australia and makes it rather memorable.  Barbara's place is clean, tidy and very comfortable. It is very handy to trains and busses (just a 5-10 min. walk) to Parkdale, where the shopkeepers are very friendly and helpful to out of towners. We thank Barbara for being a hospitable and caring host. We would definitely stay there again.
Kindest regards,

The house is really nice, with a well equipped, clean kitchen and a large guest bathroom (which is shared between all the guests but this didn't cause any problems).

Ryan was easy to contact and friendly.

Ramona is well organized. Although she was in New Zeewland during my stay was she always available. Her home is very clean and tastefully furnished. I loved the details!

It is located in a quiet neighbourhood so we are able to rest well after a day of exploring the city. It is also very accessible to public transport, just a few minutes away from Federation Square. The Shrine of Remembrance and the Royal Botanic Gardens are just a short walk away. Clarendon Street is also a few blocks away and has a lot of restaurants and cafes, as well as supermarkets. We saved a lot on transportation cost as most spots are either walking distance or just a short ride away.

The apartment itself is beautiful. It is adequate in size and has all the amenities we need. We loved that we have the toilet and bath to ourselves. Towels were provided for our added convenience. The bed is clean and comfortable. We had full access to the kitchen, and enjoyed a light breakfast of toast, cereals and coffee every morning.  

Judy is a lovely host and she helped make our visit to Melbourne a great experience. She gave suggestions on where to go and what to do, and also taught us how to use the public transport. She is obviously a seasoned airbnb host as she provided a lot of brochures to help us find our way around Melbourne. 

This is our first airbnb experience and Judy certainly raised the bar for our future stays. Should we find ourselves in Melbourne again in the future, Judy's place will be on top of our consideration."

I was out most of the times as I had just moved back to Melbourne and wanted to meet up with friends and enjoy the summer. Alan almost felt bad for not beeing able to cook for me at night and offered to drive me to places on the other side of the city to ""make up"" for not being able to show me how great of a host he is.

I would absolutely recommend his place to anyone visiting Melbourne. Thanks Alan!"

I stayed here for four weeks as I was undergoing a training at the city hospital and couldn't hope for anything better. The house is gorgeous, location is perfect as it allows you to walk everywhere in the CBD, it is in the free tram zone and finally 5 minutes from Melbourne Central, from which you can take trains to pretty much everywhere; plus Carlton gardens are just around the corner if you are a park lover/runner. Although it's the ground floor, and it can be noisy at times (as everywhere in the city), it faces a small road so there is no traffic. 

Sharyn was extremely flexible with the check-in and check-out, she gave me a huge number of very valuable tips about local life, things to do and see, places for coffee (trust her, I had the best coffee in Melbourne in one of the caf√©s she suggested me!) and so on. So don't worry about anything and just go for it!"
62606,838878,2012-01-04,819244,Alessio,93,"A nice place in a quite neighborhood, a bit far from train station so I suggest you should have a car to move around. Loretta was very welcoming and gave us a lot of insights and tips, we had nice chats everyday!"
247006,1181052,2012-04-25,2100561,Alessio,96,"We spent two lovely weeks in Chris' guesthouse! He is a perfect host: every morning we had different delicious breakfasts, he showed us all the shops and restaurants in Albert Park and introduced us to a lot of people! Some days we went out for dinner together and spent lovely evenings. Chris Brought us in the best ""hidden"" cafe and restaurants in Melbourne! 
 He was very kind and he let us practice our music (since we are classical musicians) in his house! Be sure that if you have any need, he will do his best to help you! 
About the house: the house in nice and clean!  we had the ""king room"" with a very comfortable king size bed, and a private bathroom. Therefore we could also use kitchen, living room, dining room and laundry!  We really enjoyed living in Albert Park, that is a lovely suburb, 10 min tram to CBD and 5 min walking to the seaside!!! 
Strongly suggested!!

72576,231481,2011-04-19,374670,Alex,92,"A tremendous experience in a part of Melbourne difficult to get decent accommodation in. It was perfectly located to enjoy Brunswick St, Gertrude St, and Smith St, and the city was only a short tram ride away. Having the whole loft to oneself makes it feel enchantingly like a private apartment. Ms Ramona and Mr Riley were wonderful hosts, I look forward to staying again someday."

The apartment is like a little annex round the back of the main house but has its own drive way and is extremely private. The outdoor space is amazing with a fantastic bbq which was perfect for hosting a few friends for Aussie day! Would reccommend having a car to get around Melbourne and for road trips and things but don't think its essential. Another 10/10 airbnb experience for me. So helpful and would love to come and stay here again in the future!"

The location is great, you can walk to so many bars, restaurants or coffee shops and the train station was so close! The apartment was immaculate and so well styled, it's almost too nice to leave! There were so many lovely touches like the apartment guide on the table, the Myki cards and gorgeous body products. We would love to stay here again and can't recommend it highly enough!"

Allen and his wife, Lizzie, were amazing from the start. A guided tour on arrival with great information on the area. Every detail had been taking care of to ensure comfort for their guests. 

I would highly recommend these excellent hosts. They were very friendly and didn't invade privacy at all. 

The place was clean, newly renovated and had all the comforts, snacks, tv, desk etc to make life work easily during my time there. "

From the first minute when she welcomed me with a nice glass of wine, until the last one when we hugged to say goodbye, I've always felt at home in her beautiful, clean and roomy apartment ideally located in South Melbourne. 
On top of her kindness and hospitality, she knows Melbourne by heart and is full of tips to have a wonderful moment visiting this incredible city.  
And don't get fooled by her age, she's probably younger at heart than many people in their 20s-30s, and knows where to get a good negroni in town! "

The location was amazing, right in the heart of Fitzroy and such an easy base from which to explore Melbourne. The apartment itself was beautiful, clean and stylish - a great place to relax after a day's wandering in the city. Ramona was absolutely lovely, so welcoming giving us loads of suggestions of places to go and keeping us up to date if new people were coming to stay in the house whilst we were there.

A lovely light filled room greeted us, with towels, chocolates and maps of the area laid out ready for us. Ramona's place was very clean and tidy, calm and relaxing. The great location meant it was only a short walk to good coffee, food, shopping and trams into the city. Ramona was attentive, checking in to make sure we were comfortable and had everything we needed while giving us plenty of space to do our own thing. We couldn't have asked for a nicer placer to stay or a better host! thank you! "

Everything comes as advertised. The third floor level and ensuite is a great private area with fabulous sunlight in the afternoon. I can agree that given the design of surrounding properties it is noisy if the neighbors are having a party,  but Ramona provides earplugs to help you get a good sleep. Would definitely stay again!"

The space was a little small for two people, but completely satisfied our needs while visiting. There was space for all our things and the aircon helped us sleep. 

At times, there can be others staying in rooms in the house (3 rooms total) and while we stayed there were other guests in the house as well. This was not a problem for us, the only time we noticed was when we would momentarily have to wait for the washroom.

The house was furniture from all over the world, just a really unique and interesting space. It was great to chat to Ryan about where some of the items came from and his own traveling experience. 

Overall would recommend :) "

Chris makes sure you see the other side of Melbourne, away from the tourist spots. He knows every local gem. Make sure he tells you about his favourite Japanese restaurant around the corner or Mart130 Cafe to have coffee or lunch! The house is a few tram stops away from the city centre and close to the beach.
So, if you want a quiet stay in Melbourne with a host who knows his community, this is the place to be!"

It really is in the centre of things, and even if you only have a weekend, this location will let you fit in lots of sightseeing, or allow you to really soak up the vibe of what Melbourne has to offer. There are lots of great spots around for breakfast, lunch, dinner etc, as well as drinks and coffee - also lots of good shopping nearby. The apartment itself is truly an incredible space, it really has to be experienced to be believed - we felt like we were living in a movie. The host was also helpful and friendly.

72576,1838082,2012-07-30,170431,Alexander,92,"It's taken a while, but AirBnB finally seems to be taking off in Australia.  I recently visited Melbourne for a weekend; I decided to forego my usual CBD hotel for a place in my favorite neighborhood Fitzroy.  Drawn to Ramona's ad, I booked in with high expectations...which were exceeded.

Before departing, Ramona gave me clear directions on finding and accessing her home - it was greatly helpful in arriving with ease on a rainy winter's night.  Stepping into her beautifully-designed and well-lit home instantly set me at ease and established a high comfort level that lasted for the duration of my stay.  The bed was very comfortable, and the teas/muffins in the kitchen were delicious!  I loved living like a local in what I consider to be one of Melbourne's most-sophisticated areas.

Ramona herself was very gracious, and absolutely pleasant to be around.  She is very knowledgeable about the area, and gave me recommendations on dining/drinking options which did not disappoint.  In short, she is a fantastic host!

I give a big thanks to Ramona - staying at her place was a big highlight of my weekend.  I travel to Melbourne 3-4 times per year, and plan to stay with her again if the opportunity allows."

247006,26492275,2015-02-14,26339779,Alexandra,96,"My stay was fleeting (only one night) but despite this, Chris made me feel extremely welcome and comfortable. Chris has thought of everything one might need when traveling, and is organised and thoughtful. The breakfast was delicious with lots to choose from. 

The neighbourhood was lovely and quiet but still close to Melbourne CBD and St Kilda via public transport or taxi. In the short time I crossed paths with Chris, we had a quick chat about what I was planning to do for the day and he recommended a coffee shop down at Middle Park tram stop and gave me some tips on transport which was very helpful and allowed me to enjoy my day to the fullest.

Thank you Chris for a great stay. "

There is heaps to discover just walking around and Fitzroy has a great vibe to it, but also in walking distance to CBD. There are tram stations 3 - 5min. walking distance also.
Ramona is an amazing host and you will not regret staying with here in her lovely home.

256186,15620659,2014-07-13,13729825,Alfred,93,"Hoang and her family was lovely.  The listing is great (especially for the price) and the photos and descriptions are accurate. It is a very comfortable place.  The location is great - 5 minutes walk to the tram with shops and eateries nearby. Despite the proximity to tram and shops, it is located in a relatively quiet little lane.

The listing is very well equipped, with lovely toiletries and good quality fittings.  There was even two Myki cards (public transport) left for renters to use.  Since I already had my own Myki cards, I presume renters would have to top the cards up but at least renters don't have to purchase them (about $6 per card).

The only minor issue I had was that sound insulation between rooms and between the top floor and the ground floor (which is what this listing is) could be improved.

Would I stay again? Yes, definitely!"
72576,711912,2011-11-12,1347064,Alfred-Cate,97,"Our week-long stay at Ramona's was a beautiful experience. Everything was exactly as Ramona describes it to be on airbnb. Ramona is a very thoughtful and gracious host who put in many soft touches that made us feel very welcomed, be it a jug of cool water by the bedside or sharing gifts of rare peonies ... We fell asleep each night listening to music conveniently played from the radio/ipod docking station next to the bed with bedside lights well within easy reach. It was such a delight to wake up each morning and feel truly rested in a very comfy bed with high quality bed linen and pillows, knowing that we could jump start our day with an invigorating shower with the organic shower gels and shampoos and be wrapped in the softest bathrobes and quality towels. Even the hairdryer provided was a good, powerful one. The absolutely delicious organic muffins, bread and tea were in constant supply and cooking in the well-stocked kitchen was such a pleasure! The home was spotlessly clean and beautifully decorated, and the bedroom on level 3 is absolutely fantastic for couples. There was also plenty of Melbourne guidebooks, maps and recommendations readily available. But the best asset of the home has got to be Ramona herself, with her very helpful (yet unobtrusive), warm and generous spirit, she truly deserves an award for being such a gracious host!"

The location is so ideal, only 5 min. walk to the train station and the high street stores are just a mere stone thrown away as well.  The stores are just right opposite the train station.  It was very convenient. Room is clean and there is a kitchenette with a fridge that we find very useful, especially when we felt like having some home cooked breakfast.  My daughter loves playing in the lovely garden.       "

Karen and the family were very hospitable and friendly - we had a drink and a chat when I arrived and the fatigue of the long drive that day melted away.

The room was comfortable, cosy and private and the house is set on a quiet street - great for a sleep-in!

I'd highly recommend Karen's place to others - it's a home away from home on the road - wished I could have stayed longer!"

As Alan indicates, Jack the dog will be you best friend at the first glance. I love dogs, so I enjoyed his friendship a lot. Even Amy came and wanted a little cuddle :) But I believe even if you are not an dog-enthausiast like me, Alan's pets are very easy to get along with.

If you need to stay in Melbourne for a few days, I highly recommend this place. It is very quiet, close to shops and the CBD, and the tram near by."

His space is funky and creative (in my opinion it looks much nicer in reallife than on the pictures!) . I personally liked it very much, but I think it's not for someone who is a minimalist. I didn't have any issues with the traffic noise and had a good night sleep. The tram stops right infront of the house, which is very comfortable. It's very easy to get to the heart of Brunswick and city center. I highly recommend staying at Lindsays place. He is a very warm and helpful person, who will make you feel welcome as it's almost your own home."

Hoang met us as we arrived, with a big smile and some great info on what was around the area. The myki cards came in really handy too!

The place is minutes to a tram stop which takes you right to the city. It's also a stone's throw from Smith St with great cafes and vintage stores. 
Hoang's place was neat and clean and spacious. Includes a laundry which is good for when you run out of clean clothes! There is no dryer but if you plan ahead that's not an issue. 
Place was well insulated. Was warmer when outside was cold and cooler when the weather became hotter. All appliances worked and there was even the added bonus of a fresh fruit and left over oils and spices that we could use when cooking. 
Beds were comfortable and rooms a decent size. 
There was some street noise and noise from next door but that's to be expected no matter where you stay.

The apartment is very convenient, located near to the Queen Victoria
 market and the tram stop, although an easy walk to most places in the city too. It was great to have an ensuite and the bedroom was clean and comfortable with plenty of local literature provided to help me enjoy my stay.

The rooms are spacious, and well appointed, there is a well stocked supplies cupboard and drinks cabinet that you can avail yourself to of a morning/evening.

(It was also a short 15 min walk to the Peter MacCallum Cancer Centre, for anyone wondering for work purposes.) Sharyn is extremely friendly, always up for a chat about any topic (!) and has lots of advice on where to eat, shop, visit etc. As she acknowledges, it is not the newest of buildings, but the room was clean and cozy, and we had no problems with anything during our stay. We stayed in the smaller of the two rooms and had large suitcases with us which had to be squeezed in, but the space was more than adequate for sleeping comfortably, which was all we needed, as there is lots to see and do.  She was very considerate - checking in on whether the room was too warm, or if were bothered by her indoor smoking on occasion, for example. We also really appreciated being able to do laundry - and at no extra cost too! And sharing a cup of tea :) "

We were seven guests and we booked it because of two bathrooms but we got one only.  Otherwise everything good.
Anyone who wants the company of host live to gather in same house for them it's very good. We were with our kids so we were looking for independent property.
My suggestion to airbnb to that u have space to mention it that host will live in that property or not.
Ryan's dog name Romeo is pretty and obedient, initially we were not comfortable but then after we were bit ok.

My stay couldn't have been more lovely. Lil' George Street is beautifully laid out with welcoming and intriguing detail. My floor was fab - books, flowers, light - I was extremely tempted to ditch my lectures and spend a day on the balcony pouring over a collection of Nick Cave's finest. Instead I nabbed a freshly baked raspberry muffin from the kitchen and went out to explore the wilds of Fitzroy and RMIT with the Melbourne Guidebook that my host had thoughtfully left wrapped on my bed.

Ramona's restaurant recommendations were killer, the bed divine, the shower hot and the location right in the thick of Melbourne's action. I'm intrigued. And can't wait to return."

I honestly could not have asked for anything more from this experience; I was naturally comfortable staying with this family from day 1. My room was very clean, Karen provided a great introduction of the home and what is included (ie: breakfast, laundry, cable, etc) and she also went out of her way to print out extra information for me regarding the interests I had such as fitness centres nearby. Karen and Jim's children are absolutely lovely, and I'm sure would bring joy to anyone staying with them. I would highly recommend these hosts and would 100% stay with this family again."

Malcolm was incredibly helpful and friendly;  he gave me a quick tour around the neighborhood, pointing out things like the closest grocery store and pharmacy, and even talked me through a map of the area, including tips about the local transport lines.  

The apartment itself was perfect for my trip. Cozy, warm and inviting, it truly made me feel like I was at home while on my trip. Little added touches like fresh flowers, wine in the fridge and a packet of chocolate biscuits added to the experience. The location of the apartment is also something to note - it was really convenient for me to walk (or take the city circle tram line) to the Convention Center for my conference, and also just a great area to explore. If I ever make it back to Melbourne I will certainly stay here again! 

Thank you Malcolm!"

248235,9581357,2014-01-03,7275276,Amanda,87,"The house was large and suited our extended family during our week holiday in Melbourne.  The house is very suitable for children with a trampoline and playroom. We enjoyed sitting in the private back garden.  It was a short walk to the trams which were a wonderful way to see Melbourne.  It's a beautiful city and very pedestrian friendly!

We were disappointed with the cleanliness and condition of the house.  Many items were broken, dirty or missing.  The house was not well organised for guests.  We had to buy an iron and clean pillows.  The double bed was very uncomfortable.  Most of the kitchen cupboards were taped off and there were limited cooking implements and plates etc.  The main oven didn't seem to work. None of the cupboards had been cleaned for some time so we lived out of suitcases.  The main shower hadn't been used in a while and let out dirty water and leaked and the drain was dirty and blocked.  We couldn't use the washing machine as very dirty and didn't work properly.  The pool heater was erratic and very cold (even on a 38 degree day, it had been 11 degrees overnight!).  The discounted price disappeared at payment so we had to pay a higher price than was advertised and did not receive a refund.  The carpets were filthy and I gather too old to be steam cleaned.  Lots of ants and spiders especially in kitchen.

On the plus side the heating system worked!

70004,358272337,2018-12-13,36267566,Amanda,100,"Vicki was a lovely and very welcoming host. Communication and check in cannot be faulted. I was a little disappointed to find out upon check in that the home is a larger share house and there were 2 other AirBNB guests as well as Vicki in the home. I probably would have figured this out by looking at the number of other listings, but I arrived assuming it was just me sharing the home. The house was immaculate and super clean. Would happily recommend this accommodation, but would have just preferred a more transparent listing."

67211,9660092,2014-01-04,2083897,Amaz,0,"Kate is a nice host, her apartment and room is quiet and neat as described, just note that it is positioned on the 3rd floor and without elevator. 

Actually I booked the room for 4 nights but only used 2, because I left the key in the room in New Year Eve and my phone as well. Unfortunately Kate was traveled so that I couldn't be able to contact her ask for spare key until the day I should check out I received the email. I still much appreciate her hosting.

Respond to my first Airbnb experience in Boston, I got the review from the weird host, which was completely a disaster, got a dusty tiny room under the staircase with a removed lock hole at the door, no one was in the apartment, and with whole floor empty on the ground floor in dust, that's why I worried my safety and called the help from Airbnb. I never met the host after stayed there for a few days. Unfortunately that was my first time in Airbnb, I don't even know I should leave an honest comment for him.  "

Once we got here, though, we realized we had nothing to worry about. These ladies were so warm and friendly, and made us feel comfortable in no time. They gave us lots of tips about the best places to eat, shop, and flat hunt. They were easy to talk to and funny to listen to! Having been in a hostel for so long, it was great to be in a ‚Äúhome‚Äù with built-in company/friends to talk to every night. Putting a spare room up for rent means that these two enjoy meeting new people, and it shows in their outgoing personalities. They were very laidback and easy to get on with. All in all, it was a great initiation to AirBnB and we hope we will be able to see more of Loren and Ruth! I would heartily recommend staying at this wonderful flat in Richmond if you want to stay in a great location while getting to know some lovely Aussie gals."

He was very welcoming and even offered us dinner and breakfast! I would definitely recommend Ryan as a host. :)"
215787,90141677,2016-07-31,76261196,Amy,100,"The apartment is comfortable, homely and well-equipped. The kitchen is a great size to cook meals in if you don't want to be out every night trying out all the restaurants located just a stone's throw away. It's in a great location - an easy 30 minute walk to the city, very close to all the main sporting arenas, has a convenience store only metres away and close to restaurants and shops. Public transport is very close with two tram lines as well as a train line in close walking distance. The apartment also has secure car parking. Marilyn is an excellent host. She was always very quick in responding to any questions I had and was in contact throughout my stay to ensure all was well. The only negative comment I would have is the traffic noise which is constant (day and night) from Punt Road. If you are staying for a longer period of time you are likely to get used to the noise. If you're a light sleeper, I recommend wearing ear plugs. Other than the traffic noise, I would highly recommend staying at Marilyn's apartment :)"

Rebecca was very communicative and arranged for me to check in late at night with very little notice. Pleasure to deal with.
I'll hopefully stay again."

307630,1656882,2012-07-08,2542698,Amy,95,This was my first time booking via airbnb.com and the experience was definitely a great one. The location is great with everything within walking distance. I like the house with high ceiling and its well equipped with everything you need. Sharyn is very friendly and gave me recommendations on restaurants nearby. We had a good chat on one night and it was enjoyable. Definitely recommended for people who want to stay in the city centre!
74715,27064391,2015-02-24,4603586,Amy,0,"Walter and his family were away for the first night of our stay so left the key out for us. The house was lovely and the room was almost as pictured - the only difference was no TV, which wasn't a problem as we were out most of the time! The room is away from the main house, meaning you have more privacy, and has its own lock. Having cereal, toast etc. provided for breakfast was a lovely touch. We met Walter on our second day there and he was very friendly and accommodating. We didn't get to meet Amanda or their son but did meet Sugar the dog who was lovely :) We checked out the records in the shed but unfortunately didn't get time to play any! 

The house is a 10-15 minute walk from a train station that takes you directly into Melbourne CBD in under 20 minutes. Northcote is a nice suburb - we wandered to the main High street (about a 5-10 minute walk from Walter's house) and there is a wide choice of cafes etc. there, and a K-Mart & supermarket.

We were only there for 3 days but felt very comfortable there and it was a great location for our trips into Melbourne CBD, with trains running regularly and until late at night. Would stay again if/when we return to Melbourne!

167067,15458941,2014-07-09,15360546,Amy,98,"We stayed at John's house for eight days while we started the process of finding a house after we moved interstate. John was friendly and helpful although quite talkative which is good for some but may not be for others. The room has a large queen bed which was very comfy although if you have a fair amount of luggage there it's some cupboard space. The house is next to a major road but we didn't have too many problems sleeping. We couldn't park our car at the house but there was a street around the corner where we could leave it overnight. There were shops about a ten minute walk away or a short car trip. John was home almost all of the time so this is a consideration for people wanting privacy. Overall our stay was good however we did find it quite awkward when John did have his girlfriend over for a few days and as they occupied the loungeroom mostly it made us feel like we were invading his privacy and we had to keep predominantly to our room. There was a nice hot shower, and heating in the house but no microwave if you need to cook the oven and stove works fine. John makes fridge space for you.

It was a good stay but hopefully these considerations will aid you in making an informed decision."

The location in Fitzroy is top - surrounded by amazing bars and restaurants, shops, galleries, grocery stores... Love the contrast between the high end boutiques, the street art, local pubs and old buildings. 
The house itself gives you a place to rest, a home away from home. Delicious bread for breakfast, great atmosphere, beautifully decorated. 
Ramona knows the area and local agenda very well. Tipped us on a wonderful jazz concert in Fitzroy... 
Highly recommended!"
150729,188842428,2017-08-31,9097934,An,92,"I have had the chance to stay at Little George for 4 weeks - I could not have imagined a better host than Ramona to make me feel at home in Melbourne, to help me find places to eat & to visit, to be inspired by the ever changing details in her house. Little George is a wonderful warm place to stay, beautifully decorated and very comfortable. I very much enjoyed breakfast in the morning light, writing on the balcony in the sun, a hot bath to relax, music when you come home after a day out, discovering blanket histories... 
Little George is tucked in in cool and vibrant Fitzroy, where fancy boutiques alternate with street graffiti, cosy pubs with high class restaurants, weekend shoppers with local people. Highly recommended!"

Tram stop around the corner, walking distance to CBD through wonderful parks, 5 min to MCG and Yarra River. Checking in and out was a breeze.
It is noisy at night, Punt Road is very loud, but we've got a good ear plugs. The only down side for us, was a bit small and uncomfortable bed.
All in all very pleasant stay!"

Thanks Frank and Vince!"

The area does get a little dark at night, so if you are coming late do be sure to have a torch. 
The area in general is hilly, so if you can, use a car. 

Cheers"

The house is beautiful with own character. I had everything I need readily available. Perfect stay. Definitely recommend it."

If I hadn't booked this experience, I think I would have certainly missed some nice hidden spots, usually unknown for tourists and far from the casual crowd in western Tokyo. In addition to the informations shared through the tour, Yulia shared her passion for photography and some tips to help me better enjoy my vacations in japan ! Sure the photos will be as good as the tour in itself."

150729,517400,2011-09-10,691324,Anastasia,90,"I cannot imagine a better introduction to the joys of Melbourne, and Fitzroy in particular, than staying at Ramona's place. Ramona is a wonderfully welcoming, helpful and knowledgeable hostess, and is also just a downright fabulous person. Highly recommended!"
150729,2078521,2012-08-23,691324,Anastasia,80,"My second stay at Ramona's airy, light and exquisitely decorated home was just as wonderful as the first. In fact more so - because it was such a delight to see her again, and her home just gets ever more beautiful. It is such a comfortable and welcoming place, and also full of gorgeous vintage furniture, books and art. 

Ramona is really skilled at paying attention to all the little details that make a difference to your stay - flowers, water jug, proper rugs and robes in the room; gorgeous breads and muffins for breakfast - while still managing to keep things feeling light and independent. A perfect combination for an airbnb host! 

I also can't stress enough what a great position her home is in - her place is bright and spacious, with wonderful large plant-filled balconies to enjoy, but it's literally right in the centre of what I consider to be Melbourne's most fabulous neighbourhood. If you want to experience real inner-urban Melbourne, as a local would, this is absolutely the place to stay! 

Thank you so much for a splendid return visit Ramona - I will be back... again!!  :) "

Great wifi and desk space, close to everything, great iron+board, kitchen was easy for preparing own meals. Only downside was noisy construction happening across the street in daylight hours (early Nov 2016)."
47100,942593,2012-02-22,1763924,Andi,99,"Loren and Ruth are so so wonderful - they gave me a great first Airbnb experience, and were very understanding and helpful about my total lack of planning and last minute reservations (get me out of that hostel!!!!).  I also had to do a fair amount of work while I stayed, and they were great about letting me take over half of the kitchen table for my computer and paper sprawl.  Overall, just really laid back and welcoming hosts.  

They were so open and friendly with me, even inviting me to tag along to the TropFest film festival with them, which is the sort of thing that you would never get to experience when staying at a hotel.  The room is big and very clean, and they are generous about sharing fruit and coffee, etc. which was great.  Highly recommended!  

Thanks again, guys, I had a great time!"

Firstly Andre was very helpful and so easy to communicate with before and during my visit and even enquired of my well being after my checkout, making the stay an easy one. His home is incredible, so much bigger and better than I expected, beautifully decorated and presented and so close to the buzz and vibe of Fitzroy, but a quiet, cool haven once the front door is closed. A big thank you to Andre and his family for a truely enjoyable, relaxing holiday. I was greeted on my arrival and everything explained promptly, thank you Hilary! Basil the cat is an absolute character and made the short separation from my pets back home a little easily, he is so gorgeous. Definately highly recommended!"

Location is fantastic very close to everything i needed - exploring Fitzroy. Walked to the city. As I have mild arthritis in both knees - bedding is very critical for me. The bed provided i really loved. Very very comfy. Place nice and airy with a big balcony doors you can open up when its sunny.

281890,7739586,2013-10-01,7768473,Andre,100,"I spent four weeks staying at Karen and Jim's house. The house is perfectly situated. its close enough to transport with the train being a quick ten minute walk away and a less than 20 minute journey to the CBD. 

There are smaller stores within walking distance and a quick 10 minute bus trip takes you to the Williamstown shopping district and its lovely beachfront with miles of walking and cycling tracks.

The house itself has everything you need to be self sufficient. Spacious bedrooms, washing machine, shared bathroom, and the fully equiped kitchen that you share with the family and other guests. 

Karen and Jim are very accomodating, and even though you are sharing a house, you always have the privacy of your comfortable room to retreat to. I was at first concerned about sharing a house with others, but I made some fantastic new friends and their shared experiences of Melbourne was really helpfull in making the most of my trip this city.

Thanks Karen and Jim for allowing me into your home.

The house is situated in very good area - there is a big supermarket, interesting shops, bus stop, railway station and everything you need not far from it. It takes nearly 15 minutes to the centre of the city and the same to the beach by tram.
The house is like little museum! We were exited by its cleanliess, convenience and cosiness. There were even fresh flowers in the house every day! The lack of wifi is not a problem at all. It's even better to buy your own Australian sim card. More comfortable. You will have internet wherever you go. 
Julie is the ideal host! She makes u feel like at home. It didn't matter if  we needed to talk or to have our own time, no worries. She always helped us with any questions and problems. Very attentive and gentle woman, with excellent sence of humor.
And, of course, LITTLE DOGGIES! Billie and Flossy! Our love! They are so nice and friendly members of family! Very quiet and clean ones. We are missing you all so much! Thank u for such wonderful stay at you and best wishes!

80986,249285114,2018-04-02,59833211,Andrew,100,"I enjoyed my stay in this lovely little place in Richmond. It's quite spacious for a one bedroom apartment, in a very quiet building on a peaceful street but only a minute's walk away from every amenity one could want. Stylish, well-maintained furniture and crisp clean white bedlinen and towels gave it the boutique air that the listing promised. Frank and Vince gave very clear check-in instructions, and everything worked perfectly. I'd recommend this apartment to anyone who wants a reasonably priced holiday pad without sacrificing style and comfort."

The view was pretty spectacular too. The room I stayed in was neat and tidy with a convenient ensuite. Fresh towels and toiletries were provided upon arrival. The bed was comfortable with a warm doona to ward off the Melbourne winter chill. Mario was a warm, gracious and friendly host who instantly welcomed you into his home. Great conveniences within walking distance nearby included great shopping at Melbourne Central and Bourke Street Mall. Also close to many tram stops. I would stay at his place again."

The location was absolutely perfect; easy to get to from the airport (from the very detailed instructions sent by Sharyn) and close to shopping and major attractions in the city. I was easily able to walk everywhere during my stay.

The apartment itself is clean, comfortable and feels very spacious. As you'd expect with an inner-city location, street noise can be a little loud at night but if you bring earplugs you will sleep fine, as I did.

Sharyn was very welcoming, helpful and easy to talk to."

The building was secure and relatively quiet, the kitchen well-equipped and the bed and pillows I found comfortable. The bathroom was spacious with a nice hot shower. The location in one of Melbourne's laneways was perfect and close by to everything ‚Äì bars, dining, entertainment, shopping, transport.

Honestly one of the best Airbnbs I've stayed at. The studio is a very comfortable size and the layout is nice in the sense that the ""living room"" and ""bedroom"" feel like separate spaces so you can enjoy your book / TV / gaming in one space and then wind down in bed. I didn't have a chance to use the grille on the large enclosed patio, but it appeared to be in tip-top condition. If you have a rental or your own car there is a separate driveway, so very convenient! Very friendly couple and if I have to go back to Monash Uni. I will try and stay here again."

Nestled down a wee alleyway just off Gertrude Street, Ramona's house is stunning space perfect for relaxing and taking time out. Ramona is a wonderful host who is extremely welcoming and makes you feel at home. Plus there's always a steady supply of divine baked goods from the local bakery Ramona works at - I certainly ate my fill! The location is perfect for wandering around Fitzroy yet is also only a decent walk from the centre of the city. I would whole-heartedly recommend that you stay with Ramona - you won't regret it."

51592,523105,2011-09-12,763907,Andrew,99,"It has taken me a long time to get around to reviewing Michelle and her loft but only because I wanted to take the time to do it proper justice. Her apartment was far more awesome than any hotel room we could have found. It was a highlight of our month in Australia and the best possible place we could have stayed in Melbourne.¬†

The apartment itself has a open floor plan and an incredible amount of light. The view over the rooftops toward the GPO give you a great sense of place. The kitchen is very functional. My wife and I were able to make several great meals with produce we picked up at the Queen Victoria Market which is a healthy walk or a very short tram ride away. Flinders Street Station is exceptionally close which made getting out to Flemington for the horse races a breeze.¬†

I am a slave to coffee and I can't imagine a better laneway to end up on than this one. With Brother Baba Budan and Manchester Press right outside your door you will not want for great coffee. I'm also a big fan of xiaolongbao and was very pleased to find very serviceable xiaolongbao just down the block (not something I have access to here in Seattle). Shopping and nightlife are both just steps away.¬†

The bathtub is epic. The indoor swing is a hoot and a half. The couch and bed are comfortable. The apartment is clean. The location is superb. Michelle was in the middle of a global journey during our stay but still managed to be available when we needed her (which was not often during our week long stay).¬†

I really can't say enough nice things about Michelle and her ""Central City Warehouse Apartment."""
76867,426731,2011-08-07,881218,Andrew,98,"Judy was a very welcoming and obliging host.  Thank you.  Judy's apartment is a good central Melbourne location.  Close to all the trams that go straight into the city, the St Kilda cafe strip and Toorak.  Small shops and pubs close by all within easy walking distance.  Public transport is great in Melbourne, easy to get around.  her advise re the airport bus service which is excellent was good, saved me at least $60.00.
cheers andy"

This is the first time I've used Airbnb and it's been a trouble free experience from the start. Our hosts Hoang and Michael were very welcoming and provided lots of useful advice for getting around Melbourne and the best sites to see. We were unshamedly focussed on having an AFL experience and Hoang's unit is perfectly located to get to the major football venues and other significant tourist destinations in the city. The regular tram service is a minute's walk from the unit. The close proximity (walking distance) to great cafe's and restaurants, a supermarket and factory outlets were other great features of the unit. The unit itself was beautifully presented, very clean and toasty warm. It had all facilties we needed for our family of 5. We can't wait to come back again."

However, I was unable to read the tram stop numbers, alighting instead at stop 20. No matter. It was a short and pleasant walk back. Lovely main street with many eating places open (9.30pm on a weeknight).

Warm welcome, and nothing was too much trouble. Alan's dog Jack (pictured in the circle) has Alan thoroughly house-trained, and was also very welcoming. Alan served mango and croissants for breakfast, and even drove me into the city.

A delightful short stay."
70328,129442515,2017-01-30,4548341,Andrew,99,"Raewyn has an eye for detail and her thinking through, organization, preparation and cleanliness make her property so convenient, comfortable and great value and the best advertisement for everything Airbnb ought to be.

It is just one block from the beach, and one block from the shopping strip which has a great selection of eating places and Raewyn has a great set of recommendations which we can now agree with!

Raewyn basically deserted the half of her house we could use. The bedroom is huge - comfortable bed, not a speck of dust, heaps of hanging space, a balcony for the refreshing sea breeze with a lounge on it. The ensuite bathroom is also large, good shower, impeccably clean, everything you need.

The kitchen is very well organized, very well appointed and Raewyn has thought of everything you might want - coffee plunger, tea, milk, bread, spreads and cooking implements etc. Raewyn seems to go to great lengths to avoid using her kitchen while you're there but is always available to answer any questions.

The lounge opens out onto a lovely outdoor area with BBQ, water feature and outdoor table setting. 

In short, a great advertisement for Airbnb and a lovely host."

Overall awesom experience!"
67211,62189178,2016-02-12,55224355,Andy,96,"I am sorry to say that this was a terrible nightmare!

I was told by the listing on Airbnb that ""You will have full use of all other facilities including wireless internet"".  Yet, this is not the case.  On the last few days of my stay, the wifi router was turned off by the host.  This was extremely inconvenient and I had to go to public places like Federation Square for wifi.

What upset me more is the host tried to accuse me of using excessive wifi data to rationalise her selfish act before my check-out.  I had checked my data usage (clearly shown on the router) very carefully every night (as she put high pressure on me for data usage when check-in) and I normally used ~100 mb per night and at most 200 mb.  In contrast, I was surprised to discover that she used up 1 gb a day on one of her sick leave days while I was outside and all my electronic devices were taken out with me.  

It is absolutely her freedom on how much data she used as she is the one who paid for the data.  However, it is clearly unfair to blame me for the quick use of data when she used 1 gb data a day while I just used 100-200 mb data per night and deprive me of the right to use free wifi as clearly stated on her listing!  She claimed that she had to ""protect"" herself and her guests.  Was I not her guest?  Was I not paying enough? 

To be honest, I wouldn't pay AU$45 a night for such a tiny room without wifi.  Wifi was my very primary consideration on booking this room.  If I didn't see ""You will have full use of all other facilities including wireless internet"" on the listing, I wouldn't have booked this room.  I didn't expect my stated right to free wifi was taken away so brutally for such a ridiculous excuse.  I definitely deserve a refund for such an unfair treatment (I won't do anything further for this as I don't want to have any further linkage with the host after this review)!  I won't stay at this place anymore or recommend this place to anyone!"

Our hostess was wonderful, accommodating, and her dog Henry was as friendly as a labrador can be. The bungalow is near train stop, shops, caf√©s, restaurants and best of all a 10 min walk to the beach :-) Barbara's garden is also a charming place to rest, and whenever you want lemon in your tea, just step out the door, pick a fresh lemon from the tree and squeeze it in your tea.

The king size bed was very comfortable and the breakfast provided by Chris was healthy and plentiful. The booking process was very smooth and Chris was there to welcome us.

About another 10 to 15 minute's to st kilda itself though. You can walk to the city in about 30 minutes if you are fit, south bank was a great place to visit too."
307615,461080982,2019-05-31,221067408,Angela,97,"Firstly, Sharyn is great! She responded quickly and was very communicative both before and during my stay and was open and friendly in person.

Secondly, the location is superb - right in the middle of CBD and steps away from a very busy tram station that provides access to other parts of Melbourne. There are tons of dining and shopping options in close proximity.

On the whole, my experience was positive. However, a few things did detract from my stay:

(1) Roger (Sharyn‚Äôs dog), though otherwise docile while Sharyn was home, barked incessantly if left unaccompanied. Sharyn did address my comments on this, as Roger was replacing my alarm clock most mornings by barking up a storm the second Sharyn left for work, by providing a water squirt bottle as some kind of Pavlovian conditioning stimulus. Though I appreciated that she tried to address it, this solution was really only directed at the symptoms of the problem (and only temporarily, at that, as Roger would usually resume barking after a short quiet spell after being squirted) and not the root of the problem. It was included in the listing that there is a dog on the premises, but it was not disclosed nor would a guest have the reasonable expectation of being wakened every morning by persistent, non-stop barking.

(2) If not Roger‚Äôs barking, I was wakened early by the trash collection, which comes every day and empties out several dumpsters that are just down the street (a narrow side lane) from the house, twice a day (around 4 am and 10 am).

(3) The listing advertises a private bathroom, but that is not really the case. If Shannon has guests over (daytime or overnight), then they will use the ‚Äúprivate‚Äù bathroom.

(4) The overall cleanliness of the house was a little wanting. The laundry machine had a lot of accumulated debris, and the laundry room also doubled as the dogs‚Äô water/food room (and the ground level half bathroom) so there wasn‚Äôt a very pleasant smell in the room. I did spot some mold in corners of the bathroom as well, and corners and edges of the walls of the bedroom had  accumulated dust/dirt. Moreover, a bit of an odor pervaded through the house. I had to buy a reed diffuser to mitigate the smell in the bedroom and make it tolerable. 

(5) The bedroom doesn‚Äôt have great insulation and so got hot in the summer months and cold in the winter months. The heater provided didn‚Äôt fully mitigate the chilliness in the latter.

(6) The bedding felt very old and used. Though the bed linens (sheets and pillowcases) obviously can be and were laundered, the pillows themselves were yellow with age and flattened with use. Considering how pillows accumulate dead skin cells and oils from the face with use (even with pillowcases), it felt icky using such overly used pillows, and pillows should be replaced periodically for hygiene, if not comfort, reasons.

(7) There is a limited hot water supply for the shower, and there were a few times where my showers went a little long, and Sharyn got quite angry with me, which I felt was a little unwarranted, since given the length of my stay, I used up the hot water supply only 3% of the time, and there were several occasions in which the hot water ran out during my showers, but I didn‚Äôt complain because I just accepted it as a facet of a shared living situation."

241263,1798656,2012-07-25,821966,Angela,92,"Our 4 night stay with Gloria was like being in a luxury hotel, but with the extra benefit of great company. Gloria is a very gracious and friendly host, even insisting on picking us up at the station. Nothing was too much trouble. The apartment itself is beautiful, only 4 kms out of the CBD but it feels like you are in the country as it is surrounded by parklands and golf courses and the view to the mountains and the six hot air balloons were magical on our first morning.The bedroom had a great city view and was very comfortable and the bathroom was huge. Of course all was spotless. There is lots of public transport and you are close to all the eateries in Carlton or Brunswick. My husband was unfortunately sick for all of the stay and not good company for anyone, so it was good to have someone to converse with, while he slept. So thank you Gloria for allowing us to share your fabulous apartment. We shall be back!"

You can tell she is very professional with the way she captures your pictures and asks you where to stand and how to look. The experience is something I'd never forget and am glad to have done it. Not only is it about having photos professionally taken, but being able to explore the hidden wonders of Harajuku. "

161033,352168081,2018-11-24,43053330,Angelina,85,Cozy retreat in the country side yet a few minutes away from Healesville town! just what we needed after a few days visiting the city of Melbourne. We found the cottage to be very well situated with easy access to many of Yara Valley attractions. Set off from the main road it was very quiet with only the sounds of the birds. We were greeted in the mornings by several kangaroos grazing on the lawn. Was so much fun watching them. There is a Small refridge with amenities and Karen even left us some goodies for preparing a light breakfast. Great Value. Would stay again.
86369,212624175,2017-11-18,13760879,Angelina,97,"Jerry is such a genial and fun experience host! He definitely knows his way around cameras, and even though I've been taking photos casually for many years now, I still felt like I learned something new about how to frame pictures, and storytelling, and making use of light/shadow. The best part of the experience was - we went to parts of the city that I never would have thought of visiting, which was super cool! One thing to note is - the class size was 13 the day I went, and there was a range of experience levels, from never having touched a camera, to people who were super well versed in photography. The class wasn't super tailored to any one experience level, but Jerry is really helpful if you approach him 1:1 with a specific question. "

268849,28389479,2015-03-23,26277083,Angelo,97,"This was our first experience with Airbnb and we have quickly transformed from skeptics to believers based on how smoothly it all went. Mia's apartment is the perfect base to explore Melbourne and proves the old real estate mantra of ""location location location"" to be true - close to public transport, cafes, restaurants, parks etc. the apartment was all we could have hoped for.

Mia is a friendly and unobtrusive host - she met us at the apartment and gave us a quick tour even though we arrived very late; from that point onward she trusted us with her home (and was easily contactable via the app).

The apartment itself is as beautiful and clean as it looks in the photos. The only negative was the construction noise from the adjacent development (and obviously beyond Mia's control), but even that was a minor inconvenience, rather than a deal breaker, especially since we didn't mind getting up early!"
257149,126310391,2017-01-10,107611072,Angelo,94,"We stayed in the unit eight days in January 2017. We never used certain things in the unit like TV, dishwasher, washer, and sound system so we will reserve comments on these items. 
The unit offers two decent size bedrooms with queen beds and a dresser in each. The living room is adequately furnished. The TV and sound system seemed ""old"" but as I said we did not use them to comment further. The furnishings is a collection of IKEA stuff and some old style and dated items. The kitchen has a full-size fridge, four burner stove with oven, a dishwasher (we did not try), microwave, toaster, tea kettle...etc. We were not short anything in the kitchen but the china and glassware is a mismatch collection, mostly cheap stuff. The bathroom is very tight and crammed. This probably is the  least desirable area of the unit. 
The unit is a two-floor apartment building that is probably fifty or so years old. There is one parking stall for the unit and street parking can be found as well. The area is residential and felt safe. There are shops and restaurants within ten minutes walk and transit is five minute walk from the unit.

I really felt like visiting a friend rather than staying at rental accommodation and Gloria's apartment is gorgeous, full of light, our room had everything we need and we even saw fireworks from the balcony on NY's Eve:))). We got tons of great recommendations from Gloria and I was really happy not to roam tripadvisor and foursquare, looking for places to go! The neighborhood is very calm, but close to Carlton and Fitzroy, and a short walk from CBD too. Would love to stay at Gloria's place next time I'm in Melbourne!"

The bungalow had everything I needed for my stay, including some 'welcome' food, plenty of books to read - and the bed was so comfortable!

The room and en suite bathroom were clean and comfortable. 

I loved the central location. Easy for public transport, a hop, skip and jump away from a marvellous Turkish bakery and Victoria Market. Lygon St was an easy walk as well. If you're doing a day tour, the bus will pick you up from the doorstep. Basically, if you like exploring the city, this is the place to stay in.

We came in via our own car so as we came into the neighbourhood, we realised we needed a parking permit but was not able to advise our hosts prior to our arrival.  We called our hosts and was immediately provided assistance with the permit promptly delivered to the apartment.

The apartment was very comfortable and the photos accurately described the very good quality of the accommodation.  It is just an appropriate size for a couple like us and the flat contained all the amenities required for our 5 day stay.  The flat was furnished to a high quality.  The bathroom is also a very good size although the drain in the sink was a bit slow to remove water which can be improved (but nothing frustrating).  The neighbourhood was very quiet and extremely convenient with trams and taxis available and accessible within walking distance (not to mention the CBD is really close and the stadium of the Australian Tennis Open which was the reason for our visit).   Check-out was also appropriately described in the information provided prior to our visit.

The apartment is located in the heart of the center, close to Victoria Market (a must visit), great Lygon street for delicious lunches and close to transport that takes you wherever you want. The apartment is on the 18th floor with a great view, your own bathroom and you can use the swimmingpool and sauna if you don't have time to go to the beach.
Mario, I had so much fun with you, wish I could stayed there longer so we could have gone on more adventures and explored the Melbourne city life together. I¬¥ll be on your doorstep sooner than you know. See you soon! AK PS, there is no greater place to stay than at Mario's!"

Their stay was much longer than the normal traveler, but it worked out beautifully. They were comfortable, had the 'home away from home' feel, and a good location for the traveling needs around Melbourne. Very convenient, safe and secure, and she gave you your space when needed. Gave good suggestions to places around Melbourne to see and do like a fantastic barber down the road to get a hair and beard trim. If you ever want a real home made tea and/or coffee, Gloria knows how to make it well. Gloria's cat is cool as long as you let him come to you, then all is well. Plenty of breakfast items to choose from as well so every morning you could have something different to eat. 

I highly recommend booking with her when visiting Melbourne! Enjoy!"

The things need to improve and fix are the refrigerator, spotlight at the apartment entrance and the sofa as well!"

Lulu was a great host spending time with us to show the ins & outs of the studio and provided all the local information we needed.  The studio was well stocked with thoughtful items & was very convenient to shops, transport & many restaurants and cafes.  I hope we will be able to stay again on our next trip to Melbourne."
108032,1458103,2012-06-11,2351386,Anna,94,"Malcolm's apartment was the perfect place for our stay. It is beautifully decorated and despite its small size, accommodated our small family comfortably. Its location is fantastic, with great laneway restaurants and shopping at the doorstep and Flinders St Station, Federation Square and Southbank all just a short walk. Malcolm was very friendly and easy to communicate with. I highly recommend his place for a great holiday."
268849,254169643,2018-04-16,100320137,Anna,100,"Mia‚Äôs place is super nicely decorated, comfortable, has really good amenities and I was given a clear instruction of how to get to the place though the entering into the apartment part might be a little daunting. 

The location is prime, close to the train station, good cafes and don‚Äôt forget to try the Thai takeaway place across the street (it was really good). It‚Äôs lively but not as busy as the CBD area but also so close (2 stops away) so it‚Äôs perfect for me."
161033,85399350,2016-07-11,24311292,Anna,0,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay at Karen's cottage on her property over the weekend. It was the ideal place to rest our heads after spending the afternoon/evening at Rochford Wines (ten minutes away). The cottage was clean and cosy, and had all the amenities we needed for a night away. In the days leading up to and during our stay, Karen kept regular contact and gave prompt replies. Though we didn't meet in person until we were ready to leave, Karen was a pleasure to deal with and even sent us home with some limes off her tree. I would definitely recommend staying here to friends."
283257,84902137,2016-07-09,1937619,Anna,100,"Our stay at Lulu and Michael‚Äôs started with a warm welcome late at night. Lulu had kindly supplied some bread, milk and fruit (also champagne!) and gave us great tips for places to eat, drink and shop. The space is stylish yet very comfortable, a cosy retreat in the middle of bustling Fitzroy. The location is great, quiet and relaxing yet walking distance to everything Fitzroy has to offer and easy to catch a tram anywhere further. We felt like locals while we were there and came home with fabulous memories and lovely new hats. Thank you Michael and Lulu xxx"
76867,61640189,2016-02-07,24747990,Anna,95,"Perfect Host,  Perfect location! I would reccomend Judy's place in Melbourne. Judy was friendly & helpful. Loved the South Melbourne market which is only a 20 minute walk or downtown which is only 15 minute tram ride. The tram stops  in front of Judy's place, once in the downtown you are in the Free Zone. Melbourne is a fantastic city to explore! "

The room and the rest of the apartment were bright and lovingly furnished. The location, near Gertrude St, tramlines etc. is very convenient and fun. Thank you Ramona."

Smartly equipped with everything you need, there was literally nothing I could have needed and did not have. Good heating for Melbourne winter and absolutely  great bed and shower. Communication was smooth and not intrusive even when I needed to locate something in the apartment (the modem) on a late night. Location wise it was perfect too, two minutes walk from Lygon Street and 20 mins down to the centre - and 15 minutes to Fitzroy - I walked much farther too! I would definitely love to stay here again, I spent here a month and it really felt like home! Thanks!"
227028,17094413,2014-08-07,530976,Anna,100,The most perfect home away from home. So central with the best of Melbourne food and entertainment at your doorstep yet so relaxing as soon as you walk in the door! Will be staying again!

Being able to walk everywhere was a real bonus and there is a seeminly endless array of cafes, bars, restaurants, shops and theatres literally on the doorstep.The apartment was as described and we enjoyed the art work and thoughtful touches like wine and flowers which made it feel welcoming and cosy. Malcolm is an excellent host, responding promptly to my enquiry,being extremely flexible about arrival and departure times, showing us around the apartment and offering advice about local cafes etc. Highly reccomended!"

47100,2322339,2012-09-17,2200383,Anna,94,"We spent a lovely weekend with Loren and Ruth. They provided us with great recommendations for dinner on the Friday night and Loren entertained our good friend while we were getting ready for the wedding we were going to on the Saturday. The apartment is really cute but more importantly Loren is an interesting, poised and confident young woman who makes you feel so very welcome at her place. This was our first airbnb experience and an experience we will repeat and we will certainly make a return trip to Loren's when next in Melbourne."

244952,5483156,2013-07-02,4221732,Anna,0,"Wonderful location, minutes from the Melbourne Museum on one side and all the chilled cafes and cool shops of Fitzroy on the other. An easy walk to the nearest supermarket and a quick tram ride to town so you have everything you could want pretty much on your doorstep. 

Rebecca was overseas but responded to all my queries very quickly and has included a very helpful map of the area with recommendations. I loved having breakfast in the Slowpoke Cafe and dinner in Bella's diner on Gertrude Street.

I hired a vintage bike and went all over town with ease plus a couple of longer rides along the Yarra.  There are so many great things to do, I could have stayed for so much longer!

The apartment is bright and sunny, and most importantly very quiet and peaceful for such a central and well connected location.  The bed is super comfortable.  I would happily stay again. "
43429,1715221,2012-07-15,1632276,Anna,100,"Wonderful place to stay with great hosts!

241263,43594017,2015-08-20,20336245,Anna & Viet,96,"One of our travel highlights was staying at Gloria's place. She is the most welcoming, caring and sweetest person I've met. What was more important was that they accepted our Airbnb request and was accommodate us on such a short notice. 

Her apartment is beautiful and cozy. We were greeted during the evening by Gloria and her cat. Although I'm not a cat person, this cat was adorable and entertaining to watch. A washer was available for use but we didn't have the time to take advantage of this amenity. Also, her wifi works great. 

Gloria took it upon herself to go to the store prior to our arrival to buy breakfast such as muesli and raisin toast for us to eat in the morning. She made sure we ate breakfast and had our daily dose of coffee and tea. It was delicious! 

We wish to we had more time to enjoy our stay as we only were able to check in late and we checked out early in order to squeeze in a few more sightseeing before our flight takes off. 

Her home is as described and as pictured. Gloria is an amazing person and a great conversationalist. When we come back, we'll definitely stay here again!"
150729,11720228,2014-04-13,872988,Anna And Nic,100,"Wonderful place, wonderful host! My husband and I stayed for two nights and loved every minute of it. It was clear as soon as we walked in that Ramona puts a lot of thought into making her guests feel welcomed and comfortable. She had towels, a list of things about the house and neighborhood, maps and even a lovely piece of locally made organic chocolate laid out when we arrived. Since Ramona was working when we arrived, I really appreciated that she left a list of things about the house and neighborhood. Very organized! She is extremely generous with her guests. You will really enjoy your stay here. Definitely recommended!"
108032,1321457,2012-05-21,2200324,Anna-Lisa,0,Lovely flat in center of town.  Malcolm met us and helped to orient us during our fun stay in Melbourne.  My daughter and I shared this place which suited our needs perfectly and was so much less expensive than a hotel.  Flat faces the alley which can be noisy at night but it did not keep us from sleeping!

I used Clarelee as the accomodation for the night before my wedding for myself and my bridesmaids.
We were so happy!! Everything was absolutely flawless and Lee didn't mind the call at 5:30am when we accidentally short circuited a wall of power Whisky getting hair and make-up done.

I couldn't be happier, thank you so much! "

She picked us up to get us to her place and brought us back to the airport next day.
We spent an entertaining evening having a nice meal and discussing a lot of Australian and German topics.
She offered us her lovely room with a comfortable bed.

Home. From her antique furnishing, to her magnificent vintage blanket collection, to mention a few of the wonderful things that stand out about her gorgeous home.  Ramona is the most thoughtful and considerate host with such attention to detail. I'm sure this is rare. The house is clean, warm (with under floor heating) and in a fabulous location, convenient to trams and walking distance to the city center.

Three different tram routes are close by.  The museum and the free city circle tram are an easy stroll away.  I also walked into the CBD via the lovely Exhibition gardens.
I wanted quiet after a full-on conference, and the hosts were sensitive to my indicating I needed down-time.  They were very helpful when I asked for special dietary or additional information.
The Spanish restaurant close by had live musicians - a great night out."

He showed me the Queen Vic market and was great company to have coffee with! Clean and modern apartment and he even had the hotel style shower caps which was handy! Best Air BNB in Melbourne! Mario went the extra mile as he had all the city books and maps in the room and the wifi password was there before I even had to ask, what a great host. Very much enjoyed my weekend stay in Melbourne CBD. Best nights sleep as it was quiet, a comfy bed with dark blinds which made the room dark.   "
72576,353191364,2018-11-26,9639121,Annie,80,"Ramona's home is absolutely stunning -- full of personality, spacious, and centrally located in a great neighborhood. The room was perfect, with access to a balcony and a private bathroom with a skylight. Ramona thoughtfully left a pitcher of water for me when I arrived, and always kept loaves of bread from the bakery in the fridge during our stay. I loved chatting with Ramona and meeting the cool folks traveling through as well. All in all, I highly recommend a stay at Ramona's for your trip to Melbourne!"

215787,49872216,2015-10-07,15357367,Annie,92,"We‚Äôve just spent four wonderful month‚Äôs at Marilyn‚Äôs apartment.  The location was ideal ‚Äì around the corner from restaurants and shops in Bridge Road, an easy walk to the same in Swan Street, a 15 minute walk to the city, and two city trams a minute away.  Also just across the road from the MCG, and an easy walk to the Yarra and the Botanical Gardens, which are really beautiful.
The apartment felt like home.  It was secure, well set up, and spacious (it easily accommodated our occasional family visitors).  The additional parking space was also welcome.  As others have mentioned, Punt Road is very busy but we rarely noticed it after a few days.  We did find the bed to be slightly less comfortable than we‚Äôre used to.
Marilyn was a very responsive and accommodating host and we highly recommend both Marilyn as a host and her lovely apartment.

It's only a 10 minute walk to the trainstation which comes in handy and there's a park closeby for those who might want to get some excercise. 
Breakfast is self-serving, toast and lots of different cereals/muesli, very nice. Room and house very clean.
Thanks Karen & Co., we had a great time and hope to be back someday :)!"

74548,37350127,2015-07-06,35266256,Anouck,90,"Mario was very well organised and provided easy access to building via the concierge for me upon arrival.  Apartment, room and ensuite was very clean, accommodating and warm. 

Mario was kind enough to have the room stocked with local attraction guides, maps and tram routes and gave me a welcome phone call to ensure I had arrived safely.

The location is great and one stop from the free tram routes within the city - very easy to access Melbournes highlights! (and most tour operators know the apartment complex so will accommodate pick up/drop offs).

Mario and I did not have a chance to meet over my 3 night stay due to our conflicting schedules but I will recommend him as a gracious host and will refer others here."

You just should know that it is a real bed and breakfast house, it was not really clear to us following to the AirBnb advert, so we were a little bit disappointed about some points during our stay there.
But, except this misunderstanding, we have enjoyed our stay in this quiet place and we recommend it."

The location of her place was absolutely perfect. Located in the CBD we were able to walk, tram or train to everywhere we needed. 
We had our own room and private bathroom with ample towels and bedding. The bathroom has a great shower and lots of counter space. 
Sharyn ensured there was space in the kitchen for us to keep some groceries as we stayed for about a month. Her kitchen had everything we needed, including a Nespresso machine which we used regularly.
Sharyn was incredibly knowledgeable and helpful with our ‚Äútourist‚Äù questions including weather, local activities and which tram we needed to catch. Her dog Roger is very sweet and gentle.

She, and Ruth, were fun to be around and very inclusive, They provided us with great recommendations for places to eat and have very good coffee, and where to get that last minute hair decoration for a wedding. What more could you ask for!
They are even forwarding my keys to me  that I left behind.
Their apartment is very comfortable, light-filled and in a great location.
I'm hoping we will get to visit again.

Firstly, the location is brilliant- so easy to get anywhere in the city, to the markets, entertainment, shops, great eateries....all an easy walk away. 
Then, the apartment is a gem- a big comfortable living space with comfy bedrooms and bathroom upstairs. And, there's Roger- very welcoming, highly pattable and an important member of the household.
Thanks, Sharyn for being such a great host- relaxed and always happy for a chat- you really let us feel at home. So much so, that we are already thinking about booking you up again for our next trip to Melbourne. "

Chris was very willing to help us with places to see and things to do which you would not find in any travel guide. Furthermore, the breakfast is wonderful. Once again, I highly recommend this accommodation. "
297350,104476355,2016-09-26,39957337,Anthony,100,"Ryan is the most professional airbnb host i've ever met.

He picked me up at the airport on time and it was smooth (it was rainy). Ryan took some of his time at 11pm to drive me to the grocery store as I did not eat yet. He was kind

The place is amazing, very clean, spacious, felt like home!

Only downside is if you don't have a car and depend on public transport: the bus is almost in front of the house but it takes almost 1h to go to the main center and last bus from sunshine station leaves at 9 sth pm.

But for the price and value can't beat that

Shared bathroom but separate toilets which is good. No issues.

Ryan was very nice and shared his travelling experience

I'll definitely book again if I ever come back to melbourne

Book without hesitation!

She did the pickup and drop for us from the railway station and ensured that we did not go through any hassle walking in the cold weather. All the house details mentioned in the advertisement are accurate with breakfast inclusive. She was very helpful in suggesting and guiding to the places that we went during the weekend. She offered great care and ensured that we had a wonderful experience. I cannot forget to mention the delicious cake that she made especially for us. This cossy place is the best choice for any single or couple to stay and within close proximity to city. I would strongly recommend this place for anyone and I am sure you will have a pleasant experience and also gain value for money.

Thank you Gloria and Airbnb.

He was really considerate to offer us a bigger room of his house as we are a couple. The room was spacious and neat. Soon after the chekin he showed us the kitchen and where to find all necessary items, in the living room there was a big TV and he offered us to use it as per our wish. There are two bathrooms in the house and the one adjacent to our room was quite a big one. There is a garden in the house, not very well maintained but ok if you want to get some sunshine.

Ian is a wonderful host and a very nice person. We had great conversations at times whenever we met. He is easygoing and very helpful. He was generous to let us use his umbrella on a rainy day and he helped us out with planning our day trips by providing various information catalogues of ongoing events in the city and places to visit.

Overall it was a very satisfactory stay and experience was extremely hassle free, convenient and comfortable. Would recommend this place to all the travellers."

A seriously cool and unique architecturally designed house. Plenty of space, lovely comfy bed, great kitchen. Located close to close to the beach and a 5 min walk to the Port Melbourne Tram.

Linda was a great host who made every effort to make my stay comfortable. She had plenty of helpful and interesting advice. We enjoyed several meals together and had plenty of great chats.

Linda accepted me on very short notice and able to accommodate my arrival time in the late evening.

My first airbnb experience but now I can feel confident jumping online and making more airbnb bookings."

Excellent location if you are visiting the monash university, there is also a bus stop in from of the house. (But the house is a bit far from the city center, but still reachable).
She also has a nice bird Bob who is always up for a chat too:) 
Thank you Julie for your hospitality and help! Julie tries to make your stay as comfortable as possible and has flexible timings for the check -in and -out. Enjoy your stay at her house:)"
51592,7847398,2013-10-06,7514533,ÁßãËìâCharlotte,93,"This is our first time to live via Airbnb when traveling. It's really really a wonderful experience for all of us. The house is well designed and comfortable. Although it is totally an open space. The house is wide enough that everyone can enjoyed them-self in the bar corner,in the unique bathroom, in the tv corner and semi-opened room.... Sometimes I have no idea where the kids are. And there is one more popular space I'd like to introduce. It's the indoor swing. Everyday when we got home,the first thing my kids do was sitting in the swing. Even we adults enjoyed a lot. I liked to sit in the swing watching the  beautiful o'clock shying in the night through the big window. My husband worried if he is too heavy to break the swing. But Michelle told us no problem.
Beside the location is perfect to easily go anywhere. Some days we don't go far away and turned back to the apartment taking a nap. Then went shopping again. We have had a relaxed  and nice holiday here. I recommend you who are going to visit Melbourne to try the Central City Warehouse Apartment. I believe you will enjoy too.

Thank you Rebecca!!"
150729,28522552,2015-03-25,27694274,Atty,98,"Though I only met Romana very briefly when I arrived as she was heading out of town, she made me feel at home and sent me messages to see how things go.  The place was really lovely as well. I really like her style and her attention to detail.  It was a nice surprise to receive a little welcoming gift upon arrival.
This was my first time using Airbnb.  I was not sure if towels would be provided or not so I brought mine along (from Thailand!)...Would have been nice to know as I would have had more space for shopping! Also, there's no lock for the bedroom which made me a bit uncomfortable at first (as a single female traveler) as there are 2 other people staying there but once I got to her place I didn't feel insecure at all. 
Fitzroy is a neat neighborhood, very convenient and it's only about 10 minutes walk to the city.  Lots of cool shops and cafes around. 
I would definitely stay here again and would recommend it to others. Thanks Ramona!"

167067,216441882,2017-12-03,35747896,Aumee,0,"We stayed with John for a month. The room was clean with plenty of storage. We had access to all the utilities and the kitchen. John also allowed us to use plastic tubs to store food and plenty of fridge space. The rest of the house was tidy but the cleanliness could have been maintained a little better. 

All the above would have made this a 4 or 5-star review, however, there were some social aspects which made our stay a little uncomfortable. 

- It has been mentioned a few times in previous reviews that John likes to talk, which he does. If you‚Äôre looking to have a deep conversation about more or less anything (everyday), we couldn‚Äôt recommend John enough. 
- For us, appropriateness and timing were an issue. We found that John sometimes overshared in regards to his personal life and expected us to ‚Äòopen up‚Äô in turn, which made us uncomfortable, as we are both quite private people.
- John seems to have trouble picking up on social cues, so we found it very difficult to end conversations politely when we were feeling too tired to engage. 
- John also spends a lot of time in the common area, which wasn‚Äôt a problem. Although he would frequently hover whilst we were cooking and eating and try to make conversation when all we wanted was privacy and to unwind. 
- When we politely requested a little privacy just during dinnertime, we found our needs met, but in a very passive aggressive way, and only for a few days before things returned to normal.  

My partner and I have stayed at many AirBnbs and have never expected anything more from the host but basic hospitality and vice-versa. John seems to enjoy using Airbnb to make close friends and lasting relationships, which we don‚Äôt feel is entirely appropriate. Many times we felt like we were obliged to socialise with John in return for his hospitality. Therefore, we wouldn‚Äôt recommend for people who prefer privacy and a relaxed environment. However, if you‚Äôre looking to have deep, personal chats on a daily basis, we‚Äôd highly recommend it."

My room was specious and I had a lot of privacy which is important to me. I was even lucky to get invited to dinner with the guys. Chung is an ex-cook and prepared his homemade spring roles in a Vietnamy's broth. It was delicious!
I know St Kilda very well but for those who don't - the house is located in a great spot with access to lots of places and activities.
I will definitely stay with Colin and Chung again if I was looking for a room."

We were in the third floor space which is a lovely bedroom, bathroom and study nook. We felt it was completely private. We also enjoyed the middle communal space: particularly for  the complimentary gluten free and vegan bakery goods.

Ramona was absolutely gorgeous: the perfect host with a good balance of respect for privacy and helpfulness in discovering the area.

Fitzroy is a great area and Ramona's place was very central.

We would definitely recommend and stay again."

Gloria responded the appointment immediately and confirmed very fast. She in-timely contacted me for the check-in details, and welcomed me by the gate. The security pass procedures are clearly explained.

She is so nice, generous, knowledgeable, and open-mind. She taught me how to prepared the breakfast, where to go for the grocery, food, and furniture, etc. Gloria offered several times to drive me to my destinations. While I insisted to go by myself, she borrowed her myki to me just in case mine myki balance is low.

We had a lot really nice talks. Gloria always greet me when I got back from the work, which makes my first night after checking-out seems boring.

The living room is breathtaking, and the bedroom is clean and tidy. There is even a tub in the bathroom, and the cat is really cute."

Very comfortable beds. Well equiped kitchen if you want to cook. But so many excellent restaurants close by there's no need. Collingwood is such an interesting area to explore, funky but we felt perfectly safe. Retro shops, cafes, outlet shops and so close to Brunswick St in Fitzroy. Walking distance to the city and just a quick trip on the tram. Two large supermarkets just around the corner. 
Hoang was an excellent host. Thank you, we loved staying with you and we would love to come back. Other reviews have mentioned noise. That was not a problem. Apartment was also very warm. Thank you for sharing your great apartment."

She was a fabulous hostess immediately giving me the lay of the area and sights to see including maps and brochures. She asked about my reason for visiting then tailored her helpful suggestions to aid me the most. The house was just as described in the ad and even better than I had imagined- roomy and very clean and tidy +++. It was also central to all of the Mornington Peninsula which was great for my exploration. I will definitely recommend her to all my friends and family and hope to return soon. Well done Vicki- keep it up. You're a fantastic hostess.

Only tip would be that if you are staying over a weekend be prepared for night club noise- that being said we managed this with ear plugs.  I would certainly stay again."
248235,125118074,2017-01-04,73024137,Bek,90,"This house is absolutely amazing. We stayed there with 2 families so a total of 4 adults and 4 small children and there was so much space for everyone. The house has everything we needed and more. The pool is huge and heated and although we had loads of rain while we were here still managed to get use from it. The kids loved the trampoline and the dining table seating 14 is something else. Located just a short drive from StKilda, Prahran and Malvern and an easy tram ride to the city. The hosts were lovely and easy to communicate with. I would recommend this as a base for families holidaying together. "

Considering it's my first time in Australia, I go around with No issue at all! Mario is able to advise me on where to go, what to do and how to go about. He even helped me to pick the best day for my tour to Philip island and I enjoyed myself So much! Whenever possible, he would drove me in his ""darlings"" and look around the city. I will definitely come back looking for him again and recommend my friends who wants to travel solo in Melbourne,  to stay here. Thank u Mario,  for the wonderful time there. :)"

47100,250284,2011-05-03,514547,Belinda,96,"Loren and Ruth were so great to stay with. Not once did I feel weird about being in someone else's house. They both went out of their way to make me feel welcome and relaxed; it was really like I was staying with friends.

My room was clean, comfortable and very cosy. The bed was amazing and I had everything I needed. 

I found the location fantastic. The cafes and shops around the corner had a great vibe, and it was really easy to make my way into the city - it didn't take me long at all to get confident finding my way around the city and public transport systems. Loren's directions (in emails and texts before my arrival) were a massive help. She put serious effort into making my arrival (and my entire stay) stress-free.

It was my first time in Melbourne and they both gave me tips of where to go and what to see, and invited me out with the them on the night of my arrival (I accepted their invitation and had an awesome time). 

Loren and Ruth were both super easy-going and genuinely friendly people. I will definitely be back."

Fay was kind and will look after you.
 
It was great having access to the many Universities in Melbourne.  I also attended a one day conference. I enjoyed our chats on some of the new health initiatives, particularly with someone well read in the area.
 
The room was ideal, clean and well-appointed with comfy furniture including a desk, cupboard, lights and chairs. There was a well equipped kitchen and bathroom I shared with others.
 
The home is very affordable, comfortable and in a superb location, close to shops, all amenities, restaurants and public transport.  The suburb was nice, leafy, calm and clean.  Everything one needed.
 
I highly recommend her home to stay either short-or even long term.

I will definitely be back.
A home away from home-
What more could one want!
All the best and thanks for having me Fay. 
Thank-you Fay for being such an amazing host."

76867,10632609,2014-03-01,1620165,Ben,97,"I couldn't have asked for a better host on my first visit to Melbourne! Judy is a fount of knowledge and extremely great to talk to. I could have easily passed hours just chatting with her.

On top of a great personality, Judy has worked hard to make her place welcoming to guests. I felt more like a friend staying for a visit than someone sharing space. I loved that there was so many brochures available in my room to help me in Melbourne since I wasn't sure what I wanted to do when I arrived. Her place is very convenient to downtown but also all of the areas south of the city. By far the best part of her place, though, is her view! It is simply stunning."

Ramona was brilliant, from the minute I booked, the communication and instructions were super clear and she is totally trusting. Her attention to detail is really inspiring, some nice nic-nacs and a lovely gift for when I arrived.

Ramano is super friendly and the minute you meet her, you understand why she is so popular on AIRBNB, she is a people person with a big friendly smile who makes her guests feel immediately at home. . Thanks for having me and see you next time."

307615,66225270,2016-03-20,42684561,Ben,0,"Sharyn was a fantastic host! She knows a lot about the local area - right in the middle of downtown Melbourne. She was also happy to accommodate late or early arrivals and departures. The only complaint we could find was that it was a bit noisy at night. It is hard to avoid that at ground level downtown eg. alarms, garbage truck etc, but a large apartment building with multi-levels of car park adjacent meant a lot of tire squealing. Other than that, i would highly recommend Sharyn's place for those looking for a good deal in the middle of Melbourne"

Ben"
232812,801345,2011-12-23,334656,Ben,0,"Such a beautiful, light-filled home. Rosemary invited us to help ourselves to whatever food was in the fridge and pantry, which gave the apartment a more homely feel. 

We loved the eco-touches, including the worm farm and tips on how to cool the house down by catching breezes. Not that it needed it as the high ceilings and well-built design kept most of the heat out during the day and warmth in at night. 

I'd recommend staying here to anyone wanting to experience Melbourne's CBD, Brunswick and Fitzroy but is keen to retreat back to somewhere quiet during the night."
51592,269739103,2018-05-28,146953278,Ben,97,"This converted warehouse is in the perfect location if you‚Äôre after an inner city experience. It‚Äôs surrounded by trendy bars and cafes.

Kates apartment is super nice, its funky and modern, clean and welcoming. The apartment is in a quite spot but also just around the corner from the best bits of Melbourne, Brunswick Street.

Even though Ryan was away, his great communication left us with no guess work and we felt right at home. Lovely suburb, close to shops and close to main arterial roads, which made it very easy to go in any direction. This was a great hub for the western suburbs!

They have prepared a great information book for guests for eating out and experiencing Melbourne... great place to stay!"

The apartment was well described, we were expecting exactly what we had, meaning a great 2 bedrooms with a lot of light in a quite, close to downtown, neighborhood.  
We had a car so the parking in front of the apartment was helpful.
The tram are clearly at walking distance too, even if finding a Myki card on weekend is impossible.
It was really good with kids. One is 8 months and the other one 3 years. The playground at the end of the street was good too!

The walking distance cafes, shopping area was described properly in the arriving guide, allowing us despite the long trip from China to go out easily to get food for the family."

It was easy to get to the city & shops to get supplies by car. Sm fridge in room was a nice touch with lots of wardrobe storage. If you dont mind the noise of people coming & going late & early its for you, i found it hard to sleep from this. Be aware the 'puppy' is a very large dog which i felt uncomfortable being around even being an adoring animal welfare worker, especially since it always tried to put his front paws up on me & my 4 yr old daughter. I wouldn't recommend if you have young children, he's docile but the weight & size of him is too much for young children. If you don't mind large dogs & lots of people coming & going it is a good place to stay for a single person or couple. The wifi was a real problem for me also needing to look at rentals each ngt online, id give up after trying for hours to get websites to load. It was a reason i left early. This was the opposite of what people had written & i was expecting. Great for somethings, not good for others."

The location is perfect for exploring Fitzroy. Ramona's care with the morning breads are a happy find for Airbnb places. Marvelous DVD movie collection for those nights that are too rainy or cold to go out. I appreciated the spacious closet to hang clothes and drawers for my folded items. I liked being on the top floor and didn't mind the stairs at all. Ramona provided lots of good information and maps about Melbourne, plus morning papers on the weekends.

The living / dining room was large and comfortable, the kitchen well-equipped, the building well-maintained and quiet. All was  clean and the linens and towels generously supplied.
 The apartment could not be better located and the suggestions provided an insider's view of the city. I must also thank Ramona to book for us the transport to the airport. "

As travellers to Melbourne we came to explore and enjoy the city but the moment Judy welcomed us into her home we knew we had come into the presence of a new friend.  The amenity of her home is unsurpassed, filled with tranquility and warmth, much like her personality.  Yet there is a buzz of excitement too, seeing the city lights and watching the never-ending bustle of the traffic rushing to and fro on the streets below."

Loved that it was upon the 3rd floor and that the view of the lemon scented gum and the sky was what greeted you in the mornings out the bedroom window. Rebecca was very organized with everything we needed ie tram tickets, car parking tabs etc. Her home was very charming and had everything we needed. Thank you Rebecca. Hope to return again some time.

Bright, airy, spacious, comfortable, well equipped kitchen, big shower, and right in the middle of the action of the CBD, just moments from the Bourke st mall! We absolutely LOVED it. Michelle is quick to respond and very knowledgable. The apartment does not have any blinds which may bother some people who prefer it darker in the mornings- but take a sleep mask & it will be fine. It was just the most wonderful weekend ever. Thank you so much Michelle ‚ù§Ô∏è"

It is within walking distance of a lot of attractions which are even closer by bus or tram.   It is also clearly a vibrant local community that feels anything but touristy.  Ramona‚Äôs love for her home is evident in the time and thought she has put into helping her guests enjoy it as much as she does.  I had a very comfortable and memorable stay.

It ended up just being the two of us as another didn't show and I'm not sure it could've been any better. She takes you to areas that you absolutely wouldn't know about as a visitor to Japan..she exposes you to nature, architecture, and art during this experience and her education of the city, the culture, and traditions are all an added extra. She captured moments that will invoke great memories to come for me. I truly enjoyed our walk and our conversations along the way. She is a genuine and kind person, and you'd be doing yourself a great favor to take this experience with her specifically. Thank you Yulia for a wonderful morning. This was truly an amazing experience!!!"

Our hosts provided fresh bread, milk and other provisions for breakfast upon our arrival (this was a nice bonus). 
In terms of value for money - the Old Trafford Apartment is fantastic. Instead of paying much more for less spacious accommodation in CBD Melbourne, it seems much more reasonable to rent a car and stay at the lovely Old Trafford.  We would highly recommend it to our friends."

363278,4421838,2013-05-04,5848119,Brett,99,"Alan is a wonderful, kind, and generous host.  He went out of his way to make me feel like a cherished household guest rather just than a person renting a spare room.  This was my first time using airbnb and one of my favorite parts of the experience was sharing interesting and entertaining conversation about a broad range of topics with Alan.  His home is beautiful, filled with books and antiques, but still completely comfortable and very quiet.  It was such a bonus to be able to visit with his sweet co-hosts, Jack the dog and Amy the cat, both big huge loves.  The Fitzroy neighborhood is fantastic, tons of shops, cafes, restaurants and bars within a 5 minute walk of the house.  It was an extremely easy ride to the Central Business District on the tram that stops just at the end of the block.  If you have the opportunity to stay at Alan's wonderful bluestone cottage, do it!!  I couldn't recommend him more enthusiastically.  "

Provided a full fridge for a hearty breakfast, fast internet service, privacy in our own suite upstairs, flat screen TV, comfortable beds, and our own pet dog, Charlie:) Lots of maps, brochures, etc., and recommendations re what to see. 
We thought it might be a tad too far from the city when we arrived, but soon learned that it was an ideal location....a shorter drive to Phillip Island to see the Little Penguins, and close to the train station for the ride into town. Lots of services in walking distance, and a nice, quiet upscale neighborhood.

We absolutely loved the Collingwood neighborhood - everything in terms of restaurants, cafes, pubs, and shopping on Smith, Gertrude & Brunswick - all within a few minutes walk. The apartment itself was in great condition and the bedroom is nice and quiet - perfect for a good night's sleep. The apartment itself is not on a main street so now traffic noises from outside. We didn't actually cook a meal there, but the kitchen would have suited us perfectly had we chosen to eat in. I cannot recommend it enough vs. an extended stay at a hotel."

Ryan responded quickly and communication was clear and helpful all the way through. The listing proved very accurate as to location (about 45mins by bus / train into the center or Melbourne) and offerings but undersold the house itself. Ryan‚Äôs house was extremely clean, had fans or AC in every room, great common area with sofas and a mini library, bikes for common use, not to mention his house was filled with items from his own travels. Ryan himself was always quick with a tip or suggestion and his pick up / drop off service to and from airport was extremely helpful given my logistics. He even waited an extra hour at the airport for me when I had baggage delays. Great guy, great place. Exceeded expectations."

Unfortunately, due to a busy schedule we never met in person, but I did get to meet Nina and the kids briefly and they were all lovely.

The room itself was very comfortable, and wifi was good. The self-serve breakfast was a nice bonus, and the late check-out was really welcome. The house is a short walk from the train station, a park and a selection of shops.

I'd definately recommend staying with Karen and Jim - if I'm ever back in Melbourne I would do so myself."

The location is excellent, with the vintage setting of Fitzroy providing access to wonderful shops and cafes and bars, as well as easy access to the trams for easy ferry to the CBD of the outstanding city of Melbourne.

There are a ton of nice shops and restaurants all within walking distance in the trendy area that the building is located in as well. 

The space itself has a great view, on a high floor, and has many nice touches such as high quality soaps and bath products. The washer and dryer worked well and were easy to operate. The check in was very easy as was the check out and the instructions were clear. Mia & Morgane communicated constantly before, during, and after our stay, responding in a matter of minutes if we had any questions with complete information and great area recommendations. 

One of the best Airbnb experiences we have ever had and we hope to have the privilege of returning to this space in the near future. If you value location and want a clean, trendy space in a fancy building in Melbourne then this is your best choice."

So much nicer and quieter staying just outside of the city, so I'd recommend it to everyone. Plus the bed is way comfy!

The apartment was in a perfect location close to everything (we didn't use our car once), is open, airy, had everything we could possibly need and more, and the rooftop views on the balmy summer nights just topped off the experience. I could go on for a while but suffice to say Michelle was an incredibly helpful host, very generous, made our stay easy, stress free, and we even felt so at home and loved it so much there that we have been inspired to begin the hunt for a place like this to call our own.

241263,27216019,2015-02-28,27135819,Bronwyn,100,"Gloria kept in touch prior to our arrival to make sure she would be there when we arrived. Her cat Binoche (not sure of spelling) was friendly too. She took extra trouble to cater for my gluten-free dietary needs, and even drove Ed to the train station to ensure he was able to access the ticket he needed.
Gloria warmly shared her common areas with us.
The apartment was as described on Air bnb. The views were even better in person than in the photos! It certainly was central to tram and train and we used both."

My stay was work related, but I felt relaxed in Kate's home and enjoyed my chats with her.
Thank you"

Michael and Hoang were very helpful and when we had one small problem with the fuse box (it is placed outside the house!) , they helped us immediately. Collingwood is a great neighbourhood and if you like art galleries and trendy restaurants, that's the place to be.  The apartment is as shown in  the pictures, very tastefully decorated and clean, and we will be definitely back there.  Thanks again for allowing us to stay at your great place."

It's also in a wonderful part of Melbourne, with easy access to excellent food, coffee, and pubs. But most importantly, Rebecca was a great host! We had a couple of things that we needed to ask her about, and she responded quickly and helpfully at each point. I can't imagine a better place to stay!"

Whilst in a busy nightlife part of Melbourne the accomodation was nice and quiet and provided a good place to relax as well as setup as base camp for day trips. The fresh breads for breakfast was a nice touch and meant i didn't feel the need to rush out to a cafe on each day. Will certainly be looking to come back in the future"
15246,51109975,2015-10-18,21130603,Buddhika,100,"I stayed almost 4 months at Eleni's calm and quite place. Eleni was very kind, friendly and helpful lady , was understanding and welcoming my needs. It was a fantastic place and I always felt like I was living at home. Further, it was an unmemorable period as I could learn lot of things from her like few cooking tips ;), places to visit in Australia,  decorating houses. The place is ideal for any one who wish to move around CBD as all the transport modes are nearby the house.

I would recommend this place any one who wish to stay in Melbourne."

363278,60381701,2016-01-23,20503110,C,97,The room was accurately described. It is in a very central position with two tram lines very close by and the city only 10 minutes by tram or 30 minutes walk away.  Alan is a wonderful host who is happy to chat about his beloved Fitzroy and Melbourne in general. He is an extremely considerate host who is flexible with guests requirements and likes to do the little things to make a guests stay comfortable. Each day we would chat over the breakfast he provided before he would offer to drop me near Melbourne Park for the Australian Open.  On the first day he walked with me to show me the quickest route home after Australian Open finished each night. These are examples of what is above and beyond a normal service . I would highly recommend his abode as a place to stay.

It's a short walk to everything in the CBD and Carlton/Lygon Street, and the pool and sauna were very appreciated after spending a long day wandering around the city. Mario also gave great recommendations, and went out of his way to make sure I got a morning espresso and pastry as soon as I'd arrived in Melbourne.

From the quick and thoughtful communication with hosts right from enquiry through to even after we had checked out, the beautifully styled and luxurious yet comfortable and homely space, top of the range amenities and the little finishing touches that made it feel so much more special. The location is perfect in a quiet street of a busy and beautiful area with lots to do and the train station close enough to go anywhere in Melbourne you like. Mia and Tatiana‚Äôs place was an absolute pleasure to stay in and my only regret is not staying longer, so I will definitely be visiting again!"
161033,79781391,2016-06-14,493797,Caitlin,98,"We had a great stay at Karen's cottage. The cottage has everything you need including very generous breakfast provisions! The location is good - about 25 minute walk into town along easy footpaths. The bed has a super cosy electric blanket but make sure you bring warm clothes (and slippers!) as the cottage (and Healesville!) gets quite cold in winter. Karen was lovely - met us on arrival and showed us the cottage. She is a really friendly, welcoming host."

The location is fantastic, tucked away in a funky area of Melbourne with a tram right outside and a great caf√© next door. The room was clean, appealing and warm. Comfy bed and plenty of space to stash our luggage and settle in. Lindsay is very friendly and helpful, offering advice on transport before our arrival. He also left us a list of recommendations for art, music and food. While we were out a lot checking out Melbourne, it was always a delight to come back to the flat and hang out in our room or cook a meal the kitchen. We felt that we had a lot of privacy in our room and Lindsay was often out but always contactable. The flat itself is very cool with a tonne of character from all the found objects that Lindsay collects. There is even a yoga studio downstairs and managed to get a session in one morning. 
Really cannot rate this place enough. Highly recommended."

It's close to the freeway and bus to Oakleigh and train to city too which we liked. The studio itself had everything we needed and was ideal for a couple.

240410,21996446,2014-10-27,340428,Candy,99,Neil has a great house to match his personality. It was a last minute booking but Neil was responsive throughout and made sure we settled in well. The listing description is accurate; my mother-in-law enjoyed the best sleep on her trip here. I like the feel of North Melbourne better than the CBD and was really glad to have stayed here. Wish we had more time to interact with Neil. Maybe next time! :) cheers.

74715,22028440,2014-10-28,21678392,Cara,80,We were very satisfied with our stay at Walter and Amanda's Northcote home. They were very welcoming and very friendly during our whole stay. There was breakfast laid out for us every morning which was a very nice touch. The room is very spacious and super comfortable and is located away from the home so that you have more privacy. It is a short walk to High St which was great for us! We highly recommend this place and all that it has to offer. Thanks again!

I couldn't ask for more. I felt very much at home there and would be recommending to friends. Of course would love to stay there when the opportunity arise. Thanks Daniela! "
150729,138456082,2017-03-19,9378915,Carin,80,"I stayed at Ramona's lovely house in Fitzroy after a very positive recommendation by a colleague. I was not disappointed, indeed quite the contrary and my expectations were if anything exceeded.

I think you will most enjoy staying here if you appreciate a refined modern aesthetic, combined with great comfort and an engaging and welcoming host. The local area is perfect if you love inner city urban environments that offer the best of diversity - in people, design and architecture. 

The public transport links are brilliant but there is also so much within walking distance and in the local area of Gertrude and Brunswick Streets. Fantastic shopping and a plethora of cafes and restaurants. 

There is a wide range of teas, and high quality bread and spreads on offer for breakfast and plenty of space in the kitchen, dining and living space or even the large terraces on which to enjoy it. I felt very welcomed in Ramona's beautiful house and would certainly recommend it and hope to return next time I am in Melbourne."
72576,220323594,2017-12-21,9378915,Carin,70,This is certainly my number 1 pick when staying in Melbourne. Perfect for anyone seeking very central and stylish accommodation with a very welcoming host.
150729,204581991,2017-10-19,9378915,Carin,99,"This was my second stay in Ramona‚Äôs very comfortable and stylish home. Communication before arrival was, as before, extremely easy and Ramona is really interesting to engage with but also respects your privacy. Public transport to the city or the airport is very easy and convenient. There is also so much for visitors to enjoy within walking distance. A great choice for anyone who appreciates the best of contemporary Melbourne."
210568,940783,2012-02-22,1486283,Carina,80,"Ian and Issy are really wonderful host - they gave me a great first Airbnb experience! They were of great company and were so open and friendly, even inviting me to tag along to the Sidney Myer music festival with them, which is the sort of thing that you would never get to experience when staying at a hotel. They made me feel right at home with great conversation and Melbourne tips of where to eat and place to visit. The room is big and clean, and they are generous about sharing fruit and coffee, etc. which was great. Malvern is also a very nice suburb, with lots of cafe and close to the city.  Highly recommended! Thanks again, I had a great time! "
120487,428353120,2019-03-25,184022167,Carina,95,Just spent three nights at Barbara's bungalow. It is very clean and comfortable and handy for Parkdale station. The garden is lovely and very relaxing to sit in along with Henry the dog (but no possums while we were there!)
72576,1511203,2012-06-18,2319394,Carina,95,"What an amazing little place - the house is actually even prettier than shown on the pictures. You would have an entire level for yourself, super clean, super chic interior, super lovely host!! Ramona is the best host you could ask for, as she has been living in Melbourne for years and could give you great tipps on caf√©s etc, and on the other hand you can enjoy total privacy in this place and mind your own business, if you have to e.g. work. The area around Fitzroy is wonderful for little shops and restaurants, and also just a 15-20min walk from the city center, or even faster with the tram/bus. 
Can't wait to get back to Melbourne and stay in this lovely little castle again, thanks Ramona!!"

150729,11583199,2014-04-08,2520057,Carissa,0,"Our week-long stay with Ramona could not have been better. We particularly enjoyed the open, airy layout of the three-level house with massive floor to ceiling sliding glass doors that lead to multiple serene terraces and balconies. 

Fitzroy was everything we were looking for and more. It is situated within walking distance of the CBD but we hardly wanted to leave the neighborhood. We were fascinated by the variety and affordability of the Brunswick St. restaurants and bars. And on Smith St. we stumbled upon some killer sales at designer outlet stores. 

Ramona was a delight. Always within a quick text message's reach if needed, she is at total ease with sharing her home with respectful travelers. We were able to have plenty of space to ourselves when wanted but every encounter with Romana was completely enjoyable too. And since I was suffering with nausea most days, the jumbo blueberry muffins from her organic bakery were no less than vacation-saving! 

If we would return to Melbourne someday, we wouldn't even bother to search for different place to stay. "
16760,49538366,2015-10-04,12604692,Carl,96,Colin was an excellent host. For a small fee he picked me up from the airport and drove me back to the space. The bedroom was large and comfortable. I felt very at home during my stay. Highly recommend!

I must confess I was a little nervous (I was an Airbnb newbie) but I was very impressed with the booking arrangements.

The apartment I stayed at in North Melbourne was a beautiful 1 bedroom apartment. Basic furnishings but high quality bedding & linen, tastefully appointed, great location (1 min walk to the tram & 15 mins to CBD).

Neil had everything printed out in a 'house booklet' - very handy. The price is well worth the location and standard of lodgings. Highly recommended.

Everything about the description in the ad is spot on!!"

297350,25980816,2015-01-31,7673173,Carla,91,"A beautiful home and welcoming hosts. We stayed at Ryan and Rhiannon's for 3 nights and really enjoyed ourselves. The house is beautifully furnished and has a great balance between communal space and privacy as the guest rooms are separate from the rest of the house. 

We made use of the airport pickup and were collected promptly by Rhiannon. On our first day we took Romeo the chocolate labrador out to Williamstown with Ryan. He offered to show us around and we were pleased to accept. He was also kind enough to offer us a lift back to the train station on our last day.

Derrimut is a little way out of the city but accessible by a number of public transport options, so it's not a problem.

All in all we had a great stay and this would definitely be top of my list again if we're ever back in Melbourne."
215787,32492784,2015-05-19,1099343,Carla,100,Very nice apartment in a great location. Smooth and easy arrival and departure. Noise from the traffic is definitely loud and constant and took some time to get used to. Marilyn was very easy to communicate with. Noisy road but comfortable apartment.

Yulia couldn‚Äôt have been nicer, not to mention super-accommodating. Although we‚Äôd been to Harajuku earlier in the trip, she showed us backstreets and whacky corners that we‚Äôd never have found ourselves. She took loads of pictures and has a great eye for people and atmosphere. More than that, she gave us wonderful advice about the rest of our trip and insight into the Tokyo art scene. Highly, highly recommend! "

I was able to have my own space but I was still able to interact with Ramona and Sarah (the other person staying there at the time). Ramona gave me suggestions for transportation, restaurants, etc. There was great communication before, during and after my visit. We managed to sit and chat for a bit after I arrived.  I wish I had stayed in Melbourne longer, not only to stay at Ramona's but to visit more of Melbourne. Highly recommend this place for its location and proximity to the CBD and other parts of the city. "

When he was home, he'd ask me how my day was s I'd come in. It felt very nice hearing it as I am usually on my own in my place. The quiet location felt serene and easy to relax after my busy day. Having Jack around (photo) is what gave the homey feeling since I have 2 dogs of my own. I had cuddles on the couch with him like I did at home with my pooches. It was heaven because Jack is such a loving boy. The room was cosy, warm and everything I needed. The window has a view to front garden and nice morning sun. It's a short walk to Woolworths, tram to city and many cafes and shops around. I felt safe walking to my workshop location in the early mornings, despite the cold morning in the winter, it was still a pleasant walk. The location and homey atmosphere was just perfect for me. Most especially because its closely situated to a well-known yoga studio in Melbourne that holds international workshop events which was the purpose of my trip. I would stay with Alan again on my returns to Melbourne. "

The ladies are on top of their airbnb game - attending to all our questions/needs, and then some! Loren & Ru were super flexible and chill with our opposite schedules, and we felt comfortable and relaxed in their home. The apartment was a clean and fantastic space, full of personality, cool knick knacks, and a really nice vibe. Location was great, getting around on public transport was easy - just a tram away from the city central.

The small granny style flat is just as described and is good as it has the amenities you would want. A few appliances to make tea and toast with a good sized bathroom. I definitely recommend for a weekend away as it also nice and close to Healesville (literally not more than a 5 minute drive)."

Close to trams and within walking easy distance of almost anything you want to see or do in Melbourne CBD. Rankin's Lane folk were friendly - a real ""neighbourhood"" presence - and proximity to restaurants and cafes close by was a blessing. A special place to stay - would love to visit again.

They ensure that we have a comfortable stay at their clean apartment, and recommended good dining places around Collingwood based on our budget. There were a lot of good cafes and 2 supermarkets nearby. The apartment is also accessible; it is a short tram ride to the city.

I didn't take public transport or a taxi once in five days, except to/from the airport. Everything is as it appears in the pictures, and I had a very comfortable stay. The building is very quiet, though there is a bit of street noise (nothing major and didn't last late into the night). The internet is a bit slower than I'm used to so if you're planning to do a lot of work or otherwise need to rely on the internet while you're here I'd keep that in mind.

Variety of organic teas, no coffee, soy milk. 2 balconies to chill out on, a comfortable lounge area, huge kitchen to cook in...but why would you with Gertrude/Brunswick/Smith Streets within walking distance to indulge your stomach!!! A terrific area to stay - lovely neighbourhood vibe within close proximity to the Melbourne CBD.

It is an uncluttered, light airy space to arrive to and relax in and the aesthetics are great.   I only wish I wasn't studying my whole period there!! The unit's balcony is located up amongst the branches of a huge gum tree, and the birdsong was great during our stay as many gums in the street were flowering.  How special to stay in an apartment in a city with the large trees are part of the feature.  Arriving to a very clean unit and coffee, butter and milk in the fridge was wonderful. Thank you.

I spent 2 perfect weeks at Linda‚Äôs in February. Even before arriving, Linda went out of her way to make me feel at home with notes on interesting events that were going on in the area.  Though I finally only spent a few days with her prior to having the house to myself for the remainder of the stay, she could not have done more to make sure that I was all set for my business/leisure stay and well connected with her friends both as back-up in the case of any issues as well as for company while she was gone. Not only is Linda wonderful, her house is also wonderful. It is ideally situated in Port Melbourne just steps from the beach and excellent coffee shops and restaurants and minutes from the tram into Melbourne‚Äôs business district (or a relaxing 40 minute walk if you like walking). I strongly recommend staying at Linda‚Äôs ‚Ä¶ there is absolutely nothing that you‚Äôd ever need that she doesn‚Äôt have. You will leave feeling like you made a friend for life!

It was stocked with everything you could possibly need during your stay, from shampoo, soap, some food condiments to a bottle of wine! Malcolm was a generous host. Whilst small it is perfect for one person or a couple. 

There is some noise to be heard during the night, but that is only to be expected given the location. And whilst in a lane, I always felt safe coming back even late at night.

The Italian restaurant directly across the lane is great, as is the unique French Creperie the next lane over. Two new finds to my ever growing list of places to eat in Melbourne.

Thank you to Malcolm for providing a little haven in the middle of a big city. I'll be back!"

True to photos; enough space to have what you need and no excess space which sometimes feels a bit wasteful in Airbnbs. I loved waking up to the windows of sky and (Hidden by Airbnb) in the morning. We went to the convent and farm during a stroll by the river on our last day, which was something I'd never do if I stayed in another part of Melbourne.

I wish I'd stayed longer to take advantage of the cosy kitchen and the freshly laid eggs, but access to the CBD meant we never really stayed in for food. We did nap on the amazing round couch between jaunts however. 

Bridget was a very accommodating host, offering maps and recommendations. We had a lovely chat when I picked up the key and was really responsive when I texted queries. I got to meet Bridget's gorgeous dog as well which was a bonus.

I'd easily stay here again."

Besides the apartment also the location is great. Brunswick is a lovely area with a lot of cafes and two parks really close by. If you need more suggestions, Chloe has a lot of advice and she always helps you if you need anything. There is also a shopping center really close by where you can eat and buy some food.

The house was nice and clean, as was the neighborhood; even with 3 other guests, and her family of 4, we felt comfortable due to the layout. The location is decent, there isn't too much in the direct area (a very over priced IGA and a few restaurants/caf√©s), but it's only a 10 minute walk to the train station and then a 15-20 minute train ride into the city; from there you can catch a tram or bus to most inner city destinations. Public transportation is $3.60 for a 2 hour pass, or $7.20 for a full day pass (plus a one time $6 fee for the electronic card), so plan for that if you need to use public transportation frequently.

Karen was very accommodating, and even attempted to help me find a job. If you're looking for a nice place to stay, and don't mind a 30 minute trip into the city, I definitely recommend staying with Karen! I would gladly stay again. Thanks!"

Everything I needed to feel homely and comfortable. In a great location near train and tram stops, tons of funky cafes and shopping strips. I walked to/from the city a lot which only takes 25mins and crosses a beautiful park. 
Key collection was easy and despite being on a main road the security door with buzzer feels safe and the road traffic really isn't that bad. Would def stay here again."

Usually it just ends up being me in the pictures without my husband when we're on vacation, but since this is our first big international trip together I wanted to make sure we had a lot of great pictures together to remember our time in Tokyo. The photos came out amazing and we received many compliments saying they look editorial. We especially enjoyed the tour and navigating the back alleys visiting hipster/local spots we otherwise would have not known about. Thank you, Yulia! "

Ramona is a very attentive host and made us feel very welcome and the delicious cakes and bread from the local organic bakery were much appreciated. I have already recommended her home to friends and colleagues and plan to return with my sister later in the year.

50492,456548171,2019-05-21,25960578,Charles,95,"Very quick to reply hosts but sadly a few issues left us a bit unsatisfied.  The area is great if you want to be near St Kilda fun bars and easy stroll to the water front.  Beds/pillows were comfy and well supplied linens and blankets.  Ample closet space for sure as well.  

pros- Great communication with hosts.  Area is very lively for the weekends and Monday night at the Irish Pub.  Easy light rail access very close to the CBD.  Short walk to the pier.  

cons-Truthfully- unclean- we had a roach in the kitchen crawling across the counter top. Hard to clear that after seeing it and having to get repellent etc to handle it.  Made it a bit hard to want to use kitchen at all.  There was not a oven sheet so that pretty much ruled out using the oven.  Washer was broken- huge buzz kill with wet clothes before travel.  The bathroom had no waste bin and you could not use the shower at full pressure or the room would flood. There was a note in the shower for this- again odd.  The exterior patio areas were very unkept- didn't even bother using the area.  

Sad to have to write this review this way as Frank and Vince seemed so nice in our communication.  I wish they would have listed all the issues ahead or made amends with the booking price or something due to our issues.  I think the most disturbing part was the roach in the kitchen yuck!"

Morning coffee was yummy and soy milk in the fridge was a definite treat for us during our stay there. Needless to say, the apartment was clean and artsy chic - we got tons of home decor ideas for our future crib from here! Stereos were also available around the house for us to plug in to our music, which put us right at home, and we spent our last night sharing our travel tales with Kate. Lovely experience overall! "

The location was perfect, central but surprisingly very quiet for the heart of South Yarra. The bed and shower is also amazing! Just wish there was more breakfast options/coffee and the bose speakers available for our stay, other than that - perfect!!!!
Thanks for having my boyfriend and I to help celebrate his birthday! Would definitely recommend staying."

The apartment was clean and contemporary - you feel luxurious yet cosy at the same time the moment you enter. As a host, Mia was communicative, gracious and understanding, and she has a wealth of knowledge about the surrounding area and all the different places to go for food and whatever else! She is probably one of the most thoughtful hosts I've come across, and I wouldn't think twice about staying at her place again. Highly recommend!"

Tram station right outside that will take you to the Crown Casino in 5 minutes, or tram stop up the road that will take you into the CBD 5-10 minutes.

It was wet and we were warned about the outside stairs but Dee said they were going to get anti slip pads installed very soon. Everything was clean and very comfortable. 
The listing description was very accurate, it was modern and fresh - no tired furniture or equipment.
It was a nice residential quiet neighbourhood and easy to find.  The location was very suitable for us in attending an event in Berwick."

It's within walking distance to Carlton, Brunswick Street and even down town. Even though there are bars and pubs at every corner, it's still a relatively peaceful and safe neighbourhood to be in. Ramona was always checking if I needed help when she was away the first few days of my stay, and if asked, had plenty of tips on interesting things to do around Melbourne.

The apartment is in a lovely and quiet neighbourhood 1 block away from the tram so really convenient if you want to get around the city (pro tip: walk 1 station down south to get into the free tram zone). Walking distance to some great cafes and restaurants.

As most old apartments in Melbourne, this place doesn't have air conditioner so it can get hot in the summer when it's over 32C outside (it feels ok in the house when the outside temperature is below 32). Rebecca was really considerate and messaged us the day before the heat wave came to send some helpful tips to cope with that, and the two electric fans in the house helped a lot.

I'd highly recommend Rebecca as a host to anyone traveling to Melbourne."

Trains were frequent, on time and the journey into the city took about 25 minutes. Lanie had left some ""myki"" cards for us to use, very helpful.
Lanie was easy to communicate with and went out of her way to check that we had settled into her flat and that all was well. Fresh milk in the fridge on arrival was very much appreciated. We would happily stay here again."

The location is perfect and her home is just so beautiful and private. We slept like babies in the comfortable beds and didn't hear the train once! Her cat Bella is cute and doesn't mind a cuddle! I will definitely stay here again if I'm lucky enough to find it available when needed.

Mario was very kind and friendly, met me there exactly on time, took me up to the room and showed me around and was extremely warm and welcoming.  

The room / place had an amazing view, was completely spotless and he even offered Fresh Fruit on arrival so you can't complain about that!

Mario was very kind in directing me to some fantastic local restaurants and it was a great pleasure staying there.

The Apartment Block itself was brand new, even with an amazing fountain in the lobby!

Thank you Mario for a fantastic day!"

It was so cool to witness kangaroos jumping around at backyard, while I got chance to see some other wild life running around in front of the cabin. 
Unfortunately, we arrived too late that day and need to leave earlier the next morning so couldn't have more time to explore around. 
Karen was so kind to offer self-made strawberry jam and it taste so well and not over-sweet as of those selling in the groceries store. This is definitely a nice place to stay that I would highly recommend! Well done Karen!"

We felt so embarrassing that we accidentally left the apartment access card in the rented car, Gloria was so helpful that to advise us to push the car rental company to call the current car user and finally confirmed where about of the card, hopefully able to retrieve the card tomorrow, cross my fingers... :( 

It was a perfect location with 5-min walk to nearest tram stop and reach town in 15 min. Everything was neatly arranged, good breakfast, easy parking, walking distance big groceries store, convenient eatery places... 

Not to forget elegant Bruno that welcome us everyday, it didn't miaow too much but speak with its crystal clear eyes. Just not easy for Elaine that not too close with animal.

Gloria is a very easy going person with many topics to chat but too less time we have. She was so kind to offer us a drop to Southern Cross Station, too good for us with lots of bags resulted from last-minute shopping.

This is definitely a nice place and wonderful host to stay with that I would highly recommend! Thanks Gloria!"

Ramona's home is flawless- gorgeous decor (love the blankets!) and really thoughtful little details (like a converter in the desk drawer). The fresh muffins and cookies were just icing on the cake.

The apartment itself is as described and spotlessly clean and cozy. One of the best things about this apartment is the kitchen. A full sized kitchen with everything you need to cook full meals for a family. Far better than having to buy food for every meal when staying in a motel. 
I would and probably will stay here again in the future. Very easy, very convenient, and Haydn is quick to respond and deal with. 
Thanks for the stay! "
74715,5243732,2013-06-20,812227,Chris,100,"I really enjoyed staying with Walter and Amanda. There was a very welcoming atmosphere at their house, and I felt at home from the moment that I arrived, when I was immediately invited to sit down at the dining table and have a cup of tea.  
They are both easy going people with who you can share a chat, and they were both happy to provide advice about Melbourne and Northcote.
Talking of Northcote, I must say I really enjoyed stying there, and getting to know a different side of Melbourne. I always try to listen to some live music whenever I visit Melbourne, and the music scene in Northcote is definitely on the up. Apart from the Northcote Social Club in High Street there are quite a few other little bars springing up with live music. On my first night I got to listen to 3 different jazz bands in the Bar 303 for just $5.
I definitely recommend Walter and Amanda‚Äôs house, and would happily return there on another occasion.

The location is of course fantastic and my parents were delighted with the standard of the accommodation - much better than staying in a hotel."

We had no difficulty following Loren's directions from the airport and Ruth was waiting to greet us upon arrival. She made us feel right at home with great conversation and Melbourne tips.

I had an excellent experience staying with Ryan and Rhiannon. They've managed to create a really premium, professional experience within their home.

They have a beautiful and interesting home, that is very clean and well organised. The hosts are very friendly, and were very willing to answer the (many) questions I had about the area. The way that their house is set up allows guests to choose between mingling with the other people in the house, or just keeping to yourself in your room. The room is clean and private, with enough space and light, with a very comfortable bed. The bathroom is spotlessly clean.

Overall, I highly recommend staying with them: No problems, very clean, very professional, plus friendly and polite.

Thank you for having me!"

Colin picked us up from the airport for $50 which was way more convenient and about the same price as getting public transport. The breakfasts they supplied were excellent. The house is lovely, a big Victorian place with very high ceilings and a sense of space. Transport to the city is easy and there are eating places nearby. 
I would certainly recommend it!

10803,21210727,2014-10-13,9607407,Christian,98,Conveniently located right next to the tram. A bar and cafes nearby. The room itself is quite nice with a big (relatively hard) bed. Didn't spend much time in the rest of the apartment.

167067,26399032,2015-02-11,26693375,Christian,90,"John gave me a warm welcome when I arrived in Melbourne after a fatiguing journey. House is easy to find and very close to the Glen Waverley train station (7 min walk), from where I travelled into the city every day (30 min). He helped me out on the first day showing where to get food and where I could find banks, shops I needed, what buses to take etc. The first evening he even tried to help me stay awake with interesting conversations so I would not give in to my jetlag. He is always open for a nice conversation. 
You are able to cook at his place and there is also some room in the fridge for you. 
The room is not very big, as the bed takes most of the room, but it was perfect for what I was looking for. From here I was able to start getting around Melbourne and find a place to live for the rest of my stay in Melbourne."

It also has a very attractive decoration and has everything you need to make your stay in Melbourne completely memorable.
We wil definitely come back and totally recommend to anyone.

My partner and I stayed 11 nights and found Bridget very nice to deal with. Unfortunately, there was serious building work going on three sites down from the house which was extremely noisy during the day and which we were only informed of on the day of our arrival. Apart from that we enjoyed out stay and would recommend to anyone looking for a unique stay in a fab part of Melbourne."

She even borrowed me her tram ticket and booked me a taxi to the airport. Breakfast from her organic bakery was included. It was very clean and centrally located at the hippest area of the town. Altogether I felt very comfortable at her place and would always stay there again.

The room was of good size and very clean and there was an ensuite with power shower. The access to the communal gym and pool were also a great touch. Location is central and there is a supermarket nearby. Mario was super nice and helpful and also provided useful information on Melbourne. 

My only negative comment (and that's of course outside of Mario's control) is that currently there are road works outside the building and there is some noise - nothing major though."

Mario is an exceptionally Great Host, not only he welcomes you with sincere hospitality, He loves making friends and helping you if you need any- as in enquiries to: how, where to get to anywhere as much as He could!
Not only that, i eventually love his personality so much that we ended up chatting for sometime and i really enjoyed those times, talking about anything! - Comfortably.

74548,416704965,2019-02-25,43219401,Christina,80,The place is located on the outer area of melbourne CBD. However the tram network in Melbourne is amazing so this shouldn‚Äôt deter you. It would be a great stay for a solo traveller who wants to get to know and hang out with the host- the host airbnb‚Äôs for the sake of socialising/providing hospitality rather than just a place to stay.

He clearly loves his town and loves to host. I'm calling him a Super Host! I had so much fun hanging out with him and getting to know how the Aussie's roll. 

His location is perfectly central and the room and private bathroom is wonderful. He's just around the corner from the Victoria Market and steps from a tram stop. But you can walk to all of the key areas in the city center. If you need a car, his place is right near multiple car rental offices.

I don't know what else to say except Mario made my two weeks in Melbourne the most wonderful experience I ever could have imagined. Thanks to him and I definitely say stay with him if you're a single traveler going through Melbourne.  "

They were away from the entertaining/main living space so the kids could sleep while we stayed up. My in laws stayed in the master bedroom downstairs so they could access the kitchen in the middle of the night-as they were adjusting to the time (jet lagged). The pool was a nice bonus on the hot days and the trampoline was a great for the boys. The tram was a short walk ~1 block away and about a 15min ride to the botanical gardens.

We utilised the apartment for an extended stay while got ourselves settled into new jobs in Melbourne. The tram stop is right at the end of Grey Street so very convenient to public transport.
Be prepared to negotiate some colourful characters around Fitzroy and Grey Street as for decades this has been a 'diverse' area.
There are several supermarkets close by which we also took advantage of to buy essentials.
Acland Street is close by so there is plenty on offer for those who like food and a drink."

The place is summed up by its location and its proximity to everything (We walked everywhere in Melbourne the entire time we were there). The place is found down a urban lane-way, beset by a series of old and new architecture, making the approach seem much like a walk through time in Melbourne's cbd history. A kitsch vine wrapping around the entry seemingly inviting you into a quaint home. The time travelling nature of your journey continues upon entry, as some tardis like qualities of the home are made apparent - it is bigger on the inside. You are greeted by a beautiful double height atrium, housing a series of oddities, including a hipster fixie. The house I speckled by an impressive amount I books, photos, and some random artworks (if you end up choosing to stay - when you are in the kitchen - look up).  The bedrooms were warm and cosy (ours had a most interesting plethora of snowglobes) and the beds were comfy (albeit a bit creaky for the light sleepers - industrially designed cardboard beds). The rooms were generally well kept and pleasent to come home to. Apart from the odd diy in progress, the overall apartment was terrific; it finds itself drawing on the wonderful experiences ypu would normally find in the laneways of melbourne (down to the light quality and variations. It i really a microcosm of the Melbourne lane-way experience. It should be pointed out to those who haven't had a city stay experience; that the city can be noisy (including the colossal construction site next door). For what the unique experience was worth, the price was reasonable and allowed more money to be spent eating out at Melbourne a famous cafes.  Overall, a good one."
268849,915186,2012-02-12,1365981,Christopher,97,"The apartment was perfect: clean, modern and stocked up with any equipment or food stock you would care to use. The apartment itself was extremely comfortable and luxurious, with everything you'd need such as a washer/dryer, internet, air-conditioning, a balcony, shower products and even an iPod dock. 

The location was fantastic as well. I stayed here while attending the Australian Open and it was only 1 stop to the Rod Laver Arena and 2 stops into Melbourne CBD. The train station is right next to the apartment and Mia will happily set you up with a MetCard for your travels. Not that you'd need to go far to find something to do, it's walking distance to both Chapel Street and the Botanic Gardens and there's plenty of shopping, restaurants and bars to entertain you right in the neighborhood.

Mia was an extremely helpful host and this was a great place to stay. I'm looking forward to my next trip to Melbourne, not in small part because of this wonderful apartment. "

Location was good as it is close to the CBD and the neighborhood where it is is cool because it has lots of cafes and restaurants and it has a very good atmosphere. The apartment itself is very nice and bright and it suits to people fine. In our case there were three of us and the third person didn't have much room, her room was the living room. The only drawback of the place was its cleanliness. The place was everything but clean. Dust everywhere, sticky surfaces, dirty cupboards, dirty rug, the bathroom floor and the bath were filthy. It is unacceptable that we were charged with a cleaning fee when the place was like that. We truly believe we should be given it back."

The house is stunning, inside and out, and the location is a beautiful contrast from the CBD. Every night I come home from work, I feel like I'm going on vacation. I really enjoyed the strength of community in the area as neighbours look out for another and most of the cafes in the area have a strong connection with their visitors. 

Linda is a fantastic host and there was never a dull moment as we shared many nights chatting and laughing away and watching television. Linda is always there to answer any concerns and questions and also does not hesitate to introduce you to her friends, making you feel a great sense of belonging and home and I couldn't be more grateful! 

I cannot recommend her enough. Since leaving, I find myself daydreaming that I will get a chance to come back in the future.

After a long journey of traveling from Hong Kong and going to work straight out of the airport, Ramona's place was the perfect end to the day and a brightening beginning to my trip in Melbourne. Ramona was very welcoming and warm from when the minute she greeted me and I enjoyed our conversations. During my stay, I met two other guests and also got the chance to converse with them. Ramona's home is uniquely designed in a way that it's easy for multiple guests to come together and chat but also flexible for everyone to have their own space and privacy should one wish for that as well. Nestled in a quiet street just around the edge of the bustling Smith and Gertrude street, the location could not be any more perfect, and sitting out on the balcony to relax after work was definitely a highlight. Needless to say, I highly recommend staying here!"

Thanks for the stay."
257915,24962027,2015-01-04,13167486,Clark,93,"Unfortunately our stay got off on the wrong foot - the check-in instructions were not received as we were promised, and so we had an extremely hard time getting into the apartment. We were not made aware of the exact address of the apartments, and when subsequently attempting to contact the host we could not get through. Eventually we found a security guard who helped us find the reception, which was actually in a different tower. When Dina finally was able to get in touch with me, she offered nothing in the way of an apology and instead claimed that the check-in instructions were not sent as it was a public holiday (January 1st was the date of check-in). Granted, our check-in date was a public holiday. Despite this, we were promised the instructions 72 hours prior to arrival (29th of December), which was most definitely not a public holiday. As such, this excuse did not really make much sense, and the lack of any sort of apology was also quite sour considering it was a minor miracle we even found a way in!

Despite lapse in communication and some issues with the wifi, our stay was enjoyable overall. The apartments are as described - in a great location and are also very nicely furnished. We did also request a few extra beds (only one was provided) but that was not too much of a problem. I would not hesitate in recommending the apartments to large groups looking to stay in a central location in Melbourne. "

Michelle was easy to contact despit the fact she was overseas during our stay and immediately responded to any questions we had relating to the apartment.

TV reception is not great but its unlikely anyone would be staying in such a place to be watching local TV anyway so not a big deal.

Despite the fact its location is right in the city its extremely quiet at night so no problem for light sleepers.

If you have a car, parking is a bit of an issue however we chose to drive 15 mts outside of the CBD where you can safely park in local suburbs 24/7 with no parking restrictions (or fees) close to tram and train stops.  We found we only needed to use the car a couple of times and when we did it was an easy tram or train ride out to the car, no hasstle :)

This was our first airbnb experience and I would have to say I would reccomend it over staying in any hotel.

Thanks Michelle for attibuting to a great stay in Melbourne. We thouroughly enjoyed staying in your apartment!!"

Their home was definitely chic, charming, and super tidy ---- HUGE pluses for us.  Our room was just the perfect size and the bed was √ºber-comfy, making it almost a challenge to get up each morning because it was THAT cozy.
The girls are a riot and definitely enjoy a good laugh and great conversations ^-^
The kitchen's very spacious and definitely came in handy during our extended stay.  One MAJOR PLUS was that once we were asked on any suggestions, the girls delivered on the same day!  Sometimes not even hotels can manage that and it certainly made a difference in our stay.
We seriously recommend a stay with L + R.  It was a great finale to our Aussie adventure.

The place we stayed was a nice open wood characteristic loft/ warehouse which seemed to be a great place to have friends over for dinner or pre drinks before a night out in  fitzroy ! Michell was a very helpfull person in each way which we loved . She defiantly is a person to ask what's going on in town in my opinion the way i just read about her .

76867,992506,2012-03-12,1812245,Clayton,91,Nice apartment at an excellent location which is very closed to the city centre. The bedroom and bathroom are beautiful. Judy is welcoming and nice. She provided lots of advice for our travel. We had a wonderful experience during the stay.

The location was just ideal - quiet, close to both great shops, restaurants and transport - and of course the beach just 2 minutes walk away!  Highly recommended.  "

163077,227729792,2018-01-15,100717060,Cody,89,"Elwood is a nice area. Very close to beach, local coffee shops, grocery stores and St. Kilda. The apartment is in an area which is very quiet and relaxed atmosphere. It is also easier to get in the city center by train and tram. If you take Uber to city center, it will cost around $15-20. The room is very stylish and clean. I liked it very much. The building might looks old but is fully renovated and very beautiful.
Good to stay for less than two people.
The room has a nice kitchen. If you also like cooking, I recommend you to stay here."

72576,19313279,2014-09-10,138725,Colin,96,"I always measure a place from what I miss most after leaving - and in this case, its the abundant sense of space and light, the wonderful breads supplied for breakfast, the always smiley and helpful host Ramona, and a beautifully quirky neighbourhood mirrored in the tasteful surrounds of the house.  Airnb really can't get much better than this.  If you are going to enjoy the charms of Melbourne, this is the perfect hub to do it from - so much more fun than any hotel room could possibly be.  Thank you Ramona for setting the standard in fantastic Fitzroy..."
108032,326728783,2018-09-23,104169134,Colin,97,"Malcolm is a great host, He met me as arranged and showed me into the apartment. He gave me a couple of Myki (Melbourne Travel passes) which whilst i didn't use, were a thoughtful touch. I used to live in Melbourne and know the areas really well. It really is one of the best locations because it is centrally located - 15 seconds to the Collins St / Swanson St tram stop and 30 seconds to the best parts of Flinders Lane. 
The apartment is also located within a few minutes walk to the major department stores and amazing eateries. The theatre and arts district are all within 10 minute walk so I have to say, this position is PERFECT.

I read some reviews about the apartment and agree with most of them. It is a lovely studio apartment but larger than many studios I've stayed in before. The entrance foyer is secure and access to the apartment is via a lift. There was a bit of noise from the trams or a few happy revellers going home after a late night out, but that happens everywhere in the CBD of all the cities in the world I've stayed in. It wouldn't put me off staying here again or recommending to others. The location and apartment amenities more than make up for it.

The apartment has a great sized bathroom with a walk in shower with great water pressure. The bed is very comfortable and there is a split system air conditioner to cover your heating and cooling needs. I really loved the high ceilings and character of the furnishings and fitout. There are 2 huge sash windows that open up to take in the fresh air and overlooks Manchester Lane. It faces east so not loads of natural light but nothing that can't be fixed by the ample lighting options (ceiling lights and lamps).

Malcolm also provided some great basics to get me started... cereal, milk, fruit, chocolates. Nice touch :)

If you are looking for coffee, then Dukes Coffee roasters are at the end of Manchester Lane in Flinders Lane, and Brunetti's ( famous Melbourne institution) has relocated during the rail underground works just around the corner in Flinders Lane for amazing pastries, meals and coffee. Finally if you love a hot chocolate, turn left out of the building entrance and walk a few metres to Collins St and then turn left and head about 50m or so to Lindt Cafe! 

I would stay here again and highly recommend again to others."

The cottage is in a beautiful setting, on a magnificent property. There were lovely walking paths, and a playground for the boys.   Even though the weather was wet, we still had a lovely time, and the cottage was very warm and cosy (which was great for Queenslanders in Melbourne in May).

We would certainly consider staying with Jiin again on another visit

Thank you, Jiin.

Ramona was a great host and extremely welcoming even leaving delicious bread from her bakery for us to eat.

Was not allowed to do dishes and got treated for coffee. Was taken on a tour to see Jack run...and visit some of the city's highlights.
The cottage is filled with wonderful things lovingly collected over a lifetime.
Convenient supermarket is steps away and the neighborhood offers interesting shopping, street art and architecture. Transportation via Tram is easy and also just steps away.
A truly memorable experience. Thank you very much!"

Lulu was very welcoming, approachable and really went out of her way to introduce me to this great city. 

Upon arrival the apartment was stocked with all the necessities as well as some great extras such as fresh fruit, fresh herbs and wine.

The location was great. It was central to some really good streets for shopping, drinks and food (Trippy taco was my favourite!). It was also a short walk to the CBD as well as some the best parks in Melbourne.

The apartment itself is situated on a secluded back street and was extremely quiet, it did not feel like bing in a city at all.

I would have no hesitation to recommend my friends and family to stay here. It was great.

363278,2698818,2012-10-24,1243741,Cori,92,"Alan and The Hobbit House *must* be on everybody's ""list"" if they are visitng Melbourne!  This was my first airbnb reservation for a shared home, and I wasn't sure what to expcect, but nothing could have prepared me for what was to come!  Namely, Alan (and Jack and Amy, the four-legged hosts) was an outstanding combination of generous, hilarious, smart, and culinary genious!  Even after I left The Hobbit House to stay at a hotel for work, Alan invited me and my colleagues over for one of the most delicious dinners I've ever had.  I'm sure that there are people who are just looking for a place to crash, and the central location of this place, along with its comfort would certainly be worthwhile on its own, but it was the company I got to share during my stay that really ""made"" my whole Melbourne experience!  On top of everything else, this place is a STEAL!!!  

If only Alan was willing to open up shop in the US, I'd be truly happy."

Everything that's great about Airbnb is in this home: welcoming hosts, a lovely family, a clean and comfortable room, public transport not far away, a dedicated space to store food, a shelf in the fridge - and all in a quiet, relaxing suburb of Melbourne full of trees and birdsong, with a gorgeous lake literally 5 minutes walk away. I have met other lovely Airbnb people on their way through Melbourne here too. There's nothing to improve - it's perfect. "

Once the booking was confirmed, maps and information on the most suitable mode of transport to the apartment were quickly sent through by Judy. Judy was most welcoming but also gave us space so that we could come and go as we pleased. It was great to have a bathroom to ourselves, much more preferrable to a shared bathroom. South Melbourne is a great location and within walking distance to the NGV. We enjoyed visiting the South Melbourne market on a Saturday. A great haven for foodies!

Simone and Suzane were great hosts, always open and helpful of all our requirements. They wrote a rental reference that helped us in our leasing application, and were very understanding when we found a place and arranged to cancel part of our stay with full refund.
The apartment itself was great, excellent location close to Balclava street (retsaurants, train station, supermarkets) and St Kilda (beach, Luna Park, cafes and beautiful parks), with more inside than you may need. We were able to bake and cook everything we needed for Christmas, wash our clothes, and enjoy the comfortable rooms and terrace.
We rented a car and always found a place to park.
We also receieved a wonderful present, a Santa chocolate with a card from Living like locals. Since it arrived a few days before Christmas, we told our little girl (6 years old), that it was a candy and a letter from Santa itself, we read the card for her (it was in english and she only reads in spanish), and she was really happy and excited that Santa had found out were she was...
We can gladly recomend Living like locals for anyone who wants a great short stay vacation or as we did, to begin their new life at a new home city. They are friendly, helpful and the apartment is excellent, would go back to this or any other property anytime!!"

The area was awesome I really enjoyed it. Great cafe's / shops / restaurants all within walking distance & nice people I felt very comfortable and safe in this area.  Just beautiful!  I was able to find where I needed to go quite easily with lots of people helping me down in Albert Park Shopping Area.  Chris was very busy working from home so didn't see him much however he gave me a very unexpected little gift the night i was packing ( a little carry bag with Melbourne design on it ) thanks again Chris"

The apartment was super convenient being so central and with the carpark available just downstairs it was the perfect base for us to buy our car and organise ourselves ready to go travelling around Aus.

The house is located in a lively and safe neighborhood, and near to public transports. The bedrooms are very clean. Sheets and pillows and blankets are also very clean. Each bedroom is provided with information sheets (which I believe Julie prepared by herself) on how to get around Melbourne. The bathroom reminded me of a hotel's: looks exquisite, very clean, and fully provided with all amenities you need. Feels like home. Highly recommended place to stay in Melbourne."

The apartment was clean and very well maintained. The beds were comfortable and the dounas were so warm and cosy. It was a great find for my husband and our 2 small boys (1+3). The boys loved the train track...just like the one at home :) 
It was a great central location, with easy access to trams and trains. At the end of a long day it was lovely to relax with a DVD from their selection.
On seeing that we had small children, Giuseppe was more than happy to drop over a high chair. He also offered a port-a-cot (which we didn't need as we brought one from home).
We will definitely deal with Mel & Giuseppe again when we visit our family in Melbourne in the future.
Thank you!"

The location is amazing, in the CBD, next to Aldi and in front of a spectacular view.

Basically if you need somewhere awesome to stay, that's close to the city and the best shopping strips in Melbourne, then I can't imagine it getting any better. I've stayed in both rooms she has for rent and there are both great. I tried to resist one of the free muffins that Ramona brings back from her work but to no avail. I can see myself coming back to Ramona's for as long as she operates which I hope is until she is 100! "

I had the whole top floor and couldn't have been happier with the set up. Ramona keeps her house spotless and makes sure you get everything you need for a great stay. The ipod dock was a nice touch. The location is about as good as it gets- walking distance to the best Melbourne has to offer. Oh and Ramona is lovely and ready with a helpful suggestion when needed but also gives you the space to do your thing. I'll be back! "
150729,1681106,2012-07-10,2383051,Damien,85,This was my second time at Ramona's and it was just as great as the first time. I can't really imagine how Ramona could make her place better to stay in. It is such a perfect mix of cozy and modern and she gives you as much space as you want but is up for a chat when you are too. I wish Ramona had a house in every city and town.

Always happy to help in whatever way possible, Ramona made staying at Little George a pleasure.

The house is located on a quiet street. Shops are about 15 mins walk and trams about 10 mins.  The trams go straight to the city so it is a simple journey. 

I have no hesitation in recommending Eleni's home. "
281890,5442573,2013-06-30,7046290,Dan,0,"Experience:

Whilst I was using Karen and Jim‚Äôs house to commute to and from work, I always felt very welcome. Moreover, their children were well behaved and good characters. In the event that you are not a fan of dogs, you should not let this put you off. The dog spends a lot of time outside, and is extremely well trained and well behaved. 

I had an excellent ‚ÄòAirbnb‚Äô experience, and I would recommend renting their rooms to others. 

Room:

The room was spacious; the bed was large and comfortable - most importantly clean. The wifi was very good. The room is in a house that is modern and comfortable. 

Area:

Newport is a safe, quiet and beautiful location that is an excellent hub for train and bus connections ‚Äì it takes only 20 minutes to get into the centre of Melbourne, much quicker than many other places further away such as St Kilda as they rely on the tram rather than train network. It takes just 10-15 minutes to reach the train station from their house ‚Äì it is an easy and safe walk.

I found Karen and Phil particularly accommodating, and was exceedingly grateful for use of a foot pump when my bike developed a  puncture!

Perhaps more interesting to you, their place is located extremely close to an IGA and to Newport Train Station. 

The room was fresh, bedding clean and spacious - the bed was comfortable and I slept extremely well!

Karen and Phil respected that I had early meetings and late finishes, and it wasn't an issue as I was careful not to disturb. "

Several years ago we did an eight week road trip in the States.  Prior to and then during the drive we arranged much of our accommodation through Airbnb contacts over there.  This recent trip to Melbourne was the first time we have used the Airbnb administration in Australia, and it is equally well-managed.  Thank you.

The house is beautiful and everything you need is there. The room is nice, has no street noise and the bed is very comfortable. There is delicious bread to eat for breakfast. Also a cool location. Recommended!"
244952,4552108,2013-05-12,5965793,Danae,94,Rebecca's apartment is in very good condition and is in a fantastic location. It is close to the city and within walking distance of lively Brunswick St. The carpark is very useful to have in this part of Melbourne. We enjoyed our weeks stay and would stay again.
244952,11001158,2014-03-17,3655157,Dancehouse,99,Rebecca was very accommodating in allowing our guest early check-in and the apartment suited our needs perfectly. Will definitely use again!

43429,74596317,2016-05-16,70862740,Dani,100,"Lizzie greeted us upon our arrival and was extremely warm and welcoming. The private flat was clean and comfortable and warm. The day of our arrival was a chilly autumn day in Melbourne and Lizzie had turned on the heat earlier in the day to ensure it was warm for us. The location was close to Monash University's Clayton Campus, which was the reason for our trip to Melbourne and very close to bus stops. It is also within a comfortable walking distance from the Huntingdale and Oakleigh train stations to get to and from the CBD (when the buses aren't available). The full kitchen and access to the barbecue allowed us to cook for ourselves and there is an IGA Express just a few doors, saving us time and money on food during our trip. This experience set the bar extremely high of our first Airbnb experience and we will be sure to look in to staying again if/when we return for a holiday in Melbourne."
310594,3207967,2013-01-01,392039,Dani,100,"You can see why this is called the Treehouse, when you wake up in the morning with the sun streaming through the windows and all you can see from your bed are the treetops and all you can hear are the birds singing. The space feels much larger than the photos suggest and there is a small balcony/deck and garden for sitting outside. Staying here is very much like being a guest in someones home, We didnt meet Bridget or her dog Hannah but her creative vision is very much a character of the whole house. We were only looking for a good base to explore Melbourne but it would be easy to spend more time at Bridget's place.

¬†One minute walk away at 110 Charles street is the brilliant local cafe The Milk Bar, where the owners Robert and Gerome are knowledgable about everything Melbourne. The ¬†immediate neighbourhood is quiet and residential but just down the street is a fantastic stretch of Asian restaurants and shops on Victoria street ( we ate at the Vietnamese ¬†Bay) and its a short walk to hipster Collingwood. We found all day free parking two streets away on Park street and there is good public transport nearby.

A unique house to relax and be inspired in."

He took me out for dinner and a glas of wine on my first evening in Melbourne, for a drive to see St. Kilda`s great chocolate stores, helped me to book my sightseeing trips in Melbourne and made me feel at home and very welcome. He offered assistance at any time, made me feel safe and took always care of me. We will definitely stay in touch. The Apartment is a great place to stay.

51592,70381446,2016-04-17,30127912,Daniel,95,I had a fantastic Stay at Michelle's place - before leaving I was already planning my next stay.

51592,97810145,2016-08-28,30127912,Daniel,92,"I have stayed here before, stayed here this time, and will stay here yet again. The reason is simple - I have a phenomenal stay each time. The WareHouse itself is luxurious, stylish, spacious and with a great view. The swing and spa add to the entertainment. Perfect location to the mall and to great spots lie nearby for breakfast, lunch and dinner. In addition, Michelle is an accomodating, flexible, reliable and generous host."

A little on the small side and limited on natural light but the location makes up for that as its perfectly situated in the main street of Elwood. 5 mins walk to the beach and 20 mins walk to St Kilda. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay and France and Vince were great to deal with. Perfect for a couple who want to get out and about and make the most of Melbourne. Lynne and Graham Sim

Linda was such a welcoming and generous host, aided by a delightfully effusive greeting from Boof the dog. The room was cosy and cool, even on the hottest days, with a very comfortable bed and a five-star shower. I enjoyed taking a refreshing dip in the pool, and friendly chats with Linda who supplied many good tips about the area. Transport is great from here, with a tram line direct into the city, bikeshare available at the end of the street, and even a regular ferry service to St Kilda and Williamstown. The apartment is beautiful and very peaceful, I can't recommend it enough and will definitely come back next time I am in Melbourne!"

The room is spacious, the bed is very comfortable and there are two windows with great lighting - one gets you to the balcony.

The house is very cosy and I felt really good all the time. There is a great vibe in her house!

Eleni was very available for every type of questions and concerns about coming and moving to Melbourne. During my visit we had good conversations. I would recommend this place to everybody. "

She's upbeat and a good conversation partner for lonely dinners. What's more when I got lost navigating the streets of Frankston she came right to my rescue and led me back safely! (thanks again for that again vicki!) The house is also as welcoming as she is. With a warmly lit kitchen and living area this house surrounds you with its light and comfort.

257915,26214721,2015-02-07,9165208,Dave,89,"Great location and nice, clean, modern apartments. Dina was very helpful in organising the stay which is a bit tricky with a large group of 9 - staying in 2 apartments. The apartment complex had a small gym and pool and was a short walk to the main city.

Only downer was the lack of keys. With 6 people in one apartment it would have been great to have more than 2 sets of keys to give everyone some flexibility to come and go as they pleased after 10pm."
43429,112814061,2016-11-07,1742669,Dave,99,"Great place. Close enough to suburban and city centre attractions. It's great if you have a car, but, if not, there is public transport available nearby. It was our third time to stay at Allan's place - always enjoyable."

Although it is a shared bathroom and common area with other guests, it is very clean and comfortable. The private bedroom was very functional and the bed was great. Karen has a very friendly family and dog, all of whom we enjoyed. Karen made some solid dining recommendations within walking distance.This is also a convenient location to access the Melbourne airport. "

If you are looking for a great place to stay in the quieter outer suburbs of Melbourne or look for a place close to Monash University, I can most certainly recommend staying with Allan and Lissie."
72576,61023207,2016-01-31,12132082,David,80,"An excellent location, a tastefully decorated and immaculate place to stay and a gracious and helpful host. Everything went well and Ramona did a great job communicating with us and pointing us in the right direction.

76867,52324346,2015-10-28,43726947,David,98,"An excellent property with great views from the 11th floor.  It is a short walk to the Domain interchange tram stop which has a frequent, fast and efficient choice of trams to the city centre as well as to St Kilda beach.  I found it a great base for three days in the city.  Comfy and clean double bedroom with own bathroom and toilet.  Judy was a very friendly and helpful host who made my first Air B&B stay a pleasure.  I can also recommend the Olive Tree restaurant just two minutes from Judy's front door for good Italian food nearby."
257915,25546927,2015-01-19,21166533,David,94,"Apartments are great for groups, reasonable value, clean and and in an excellent location.

Short walking distance to bars/restaurants,CBD and comfortable walk along the river to MCG, AAMI Park and Melbourne Park Tennis Centre.

Apartments have everything required for entertaining as well as cooking.

Dina was flexible after a late booking clarification was required, and provided everything required for our group to have a great stay. 

Would recommend the apartments to couples having a weekend in Melbourne, and especially for larger groups wanting to stay centrally."
256186,11344793,2014-03-31,1572161,David,97,"As an expat who rarely gets to visit home, Hoang's wonderful apartment made our most recent visit to Melbourne all the more memorable and enjoyable, and allowed us to decompress in privacy (and luxury) following the typical family reunions and catch-ups. 

All of the previous reviews are pretty much spot-on, so book with confidence knowing that you will be staying in an extremely well-appointed apartment in the heart of vibrant Collingwood. All amenities you could wish for, including a very reliable WiFi connection and spectacular kitchen. 

We'll definitely stay there again. Thanks so much Hoang!

PS: Be sure to visit Jimmy Grants, less than 5 minutes walk away, for some delicious and modestly-priced Greek cuisine. Yum!"

Her apartment in the heart of the Melbourne CBD is stunning  - a light, bright modern renovation in an historic building - and has everything you could want.  You are easy walking distance from the museums, galleries, shopping, restaurants, etc. and, if you decide you just want to take time off, we couldn't think of a more relaxing place to do so.  Would have stayed longer if we could have."

The unit is exactly as described, also if you are into cooking the kitchen is very well equipped. The unit is very quiet and comfortable and is walking distance to CBD, or a $6 Uber ride away"
51592,421176556,2019-03-08,25735203,David,94,"First off, excellent location. A few feet away from everything, including Hardware Lane, which had more great restaurants than I was able to attend.

Second, the apartment is huge! Lots and lots of space with a great fun layout, including loft, swing, and rooftop deck. Lots of sun in the mornings, in a great building. Just lots of fun. 

Third, Michelle was an excellent host, in all ways. She had the apartment ready for our late arrival, including with multiple fans to deal with the heat that just blasted Melbourne. 

Overall, a great stay."
241263,12416650,2014-05-01,13835387,David,0,Gloria was the perfect host for our all too short time together. Our every need was catered for and we enjoyed her company. The apartment has to die for views over the inner suburbs with secure parking and easy access to public transport. We have no hesitation in recommending it as a great place to stay.

Loren and her partner Ruth were fantastici hosts - actually the type of people I enjoy hanging out with; creative, fun, smart and open minded. Their little home was all I needed for my visit to Melbourne and I would definitely recommend them to anyone visiting Melbourne - really an excellent location to be based when visiting Melbs. "

256186,3813293,2013-03-18,4220411,David,93,"Hoang and her family were the perfect hosts for my time in Melbourne.  She greeted me at the front door with a cold bottle of Proseco and a bowl of fruit. It was most welcomed after a very late arrival. The flat is perfectly located near the shopping, bakeries and coffee shops on Smith St.
The spacious flat was roomy with everything I needed for a long stay in Melbourne. I really appreciated a washing machine and lots of room to store a bicycle. "
74548,19569553,2014-09-14,3168592,David,0,"I had a great time staying with Mario.  The location is fantastic, right next to the Victoria Markets and close to lots of good cafes and shopping.  Mario's apartment is very comfortable and has a nice view out over the city buildings.  The room is great, with an en suite bathroom,  has gone to the trouble of providing helpful things like, spare toiletries, a public transport pass, etc.

But what I liked best about my stay was actually meeting and hanging out with Mario.  He's friendly, relaxed, and interesting, and goes out of his way to entertain his guests.  He even talk me on a walking tour of his favourite markets and introduced me to some of his friends.  Great fun."
74548,71652474,2016-04-27,21849767,David,96,I had an amazing time. I spent 4 days exploring Melbourne and was able to walk everywhere because the location of the apartment was in the middle of the city. Mario and his family were amazing.  I felt as if they were my family. They pointed me the right direction and told me the shortcuts of the city. The room itself was very spacious and the bathroom was stocked. The gym was fantastic and had its very own indoor pool. It was great. I will def return and stay with Mario
111001,240735771,2018-03-05,27384442,David,95,I looked through all the Airbnb experiences in Tokyo related to photography and Yulia‚Äôs portfolio of photos stood out to me as being the best of them. I had a wonderful experience with her - she was able to take great photos of both the couple I was with and myself. She is super easy to get along with and showed us some great hidden local spots (places you‚Äôd only find with someone who had explored the neighborhood extensively). I would totally recommend her to all my friends as an exceptional Airbnb experience! 
76867,10319938,2014-02-13,7443448,David,96,"I never realized how much Melbourne had to offer until I stayed in Judy's beautiful penthouse condo. There is something to do and see from every direction out her front entrance. The building she is in is very clean and secure, even late at night. The sunset from her balcony is postcard quality. I had not made any definitive plans for this part of my trip so. I took Judy's advice everyday. I covered a lot of ground by walking and the tram was always an option if I got tired. It was always nice to come home to Judy and share my daily adventures. She has a genuine interest in people and is so easy to talk to that we kept each other up later than we should have. I would truly recommend this host to anybody who is looking for a clean, comfortable place to experience Melbourne.  "
297350,260151869,2018-05-03,187371961,David,99,"If you want the most super host and beautiful place to stay, then contact Ryan to make your stay more enjoyable."

Assisted with Mario's extensive knowledge of the City and great recommendations I really felt like I got to see a decent amount of Melbourne in the week I stayed there.

The apartment is also fantastic with great views over the City, ensuite bedroom and an on-site gym, pool and tennis court. Mario makes a real effort to make you feel at home and provide any information or ideas on how to make the most of your time in Melbourne whilst also respecting your privacy.

This was my first time using Airbnb and I well and truly landed on my feet with this one, and gained a good mate out of it too! 

Totally exceeded expectations! Thanks Mario!"
76867,9233191,2013-12-15,6706941,David,98,"Judy was the best of hosts and her condo was a great base for our stay in Melbourne.  An AirBnB traveler as well as host, she appreciates what a traveler is looking for in a host and rental.

Judy makes you feel very comfortable and welcome.  Great to speak with and great at letting you be and do your thing.

We wish had planned more time in Melbourne and part of the reason was Judy and her apartment.

Thanks Judy!"
161033,1462389,2012-06-11,847963,David,98,"Karen and Michael's cabin was my first airBnB stay, and it was a very encouraging start.  The cabin is perfectly modest, solid, and comfortable; containing everything we needed and a little bit more.  Karen provided helpful suggestions in the days before our trip and put us immediately at ease upon arrival. The continental breakfast was a melancholy reminder of how good all those other continental breakfasts you've eaten could have been.  We would go back for sure."
161033,23969971,2014-12-15,13376174,David,99,Karen met us at her wonderful property and went above and beyond to make the stay more pleasant for my folks.

Her placed has a great history - being a part of the Swallow Biscuit factory complex, and converted by a very clever architect.  Quiet bedroom has very high quality bed and fittings.  In all, it was great to meet Linda and share a few evenings in her home."

72576,5480976,2013-07-02,2080973,David,98,"Ramona was a perfect hostess.  She couldn't do enough for us.  The accommodation is superb.  We stayed for 3 nights in the second floor apartment with our own bathroom.

Ramona's house is a wee bit from the city centre, but a tram stops at the end of the street, and if you are energetic and fit, a 30 minute walk takes you in the main shopping area.

I cannot fault our experience with Ramona, and should we return to Melbourne, I would definitely look use Airbnb and Romona.

150729,26483691,2015-02-14,25226160,David,97,"Ramona's house is spacious, immaculate and full of carefully chosen objects and she shares almost all of it with her guests. She herself is helpful and enthusiastic. We very much enjoyed staying with her."

Staying with them was an absolute pleasure. They were talkative when we were up for it, respectful of privacy and adaptable to any reasonable requests.

Would not hesitate to stay with them again! Thanks guys!"
297350,84987013,2016-07-10,71458480,David,80,"Ryan is welcoming. The house is decorated with handicrafts from many places. I thought I was in Southeast Asia when I saw the giant Buddha head statue. The house is big with 3 guestrooms. The visitors can spend their time  in a living room. Bedrooms are too small to fit in two 28"" luggage, but we could leave the luggage outside our rooms. There are grocery shop and restaurants 5 minute drive away. the house is 30 min drive from Melbourne city center.  We love the dog called Romeo, it's the friendliest dog in earth. it welcomed us by showing its toy.  Free Wifi is provided. There is no water tap in the toilet, you can wash your hands either in bathroom or laundry room. "

It is really in the heart of the city--so don't expect quiet country living. It is extremely convenient to all of the CBD and in the center of the free tram zone. Just a six minute walk to Flinders Station and no more than 20 minutes walk to most of the CBD--but it so convenient to multiple trams you won't have to walk. Just minutes by tram to Victoria Market, three minute jog to the river and South Bank"

I stayed there a total of 13 nights so it easily become ""my home"" feeling.  For total luxury though, I suggest the top floor....the ""penthouse"" of the bed and breakfast.  Hopefully will get a chance to stay there again in the future. 
Fitzroy is a trendy area, nice local pub a few minutes away and only a 15 mintute walk to the city. Highly recommended. Thanks Ramona"

Both hosts are  very friendly and welcoming, their children delightful and Otto the Groodle loves a pat .

Perfect for business or couples exploring the city. 

Frank and Vince have pretty much thought of everything you need and the property, fixtures and fittings are in excellent condition.

His knowledge of all things Melbourne is excellent and I really enjoyed his company. Mario's apartment is ideally situated and so close to Melbourne CBD, Lygon Street and the famous Queen Victoria Markets just around the corner. You can walk to the heart of Melbourne CBD in minutes or jump on a tram only a few meters from his apartment. 
The single room is ideal for the single traveler, nice and clean and has its own ensuite. I was so impressed with the location and Mario as a host I'm really looking forward to getting back to Melbourne again soon! 
Thanks for a great holiday!"

Did not hear our host go out to work-clue each morning that the host had left were the Billy and Flossy the Scotties, who would sit very quietly at the top of the stairs to welcome us each morning.

Ramona made everything easy and it was great to be in someone's home, and to be able to use all the facilities like the upstairs terrace for sitting out, yet never feel that we intruded on her space.

Ramona's home is even more lovely than the photos suggest, and she as a great sense of style. We would love to stay here the next time we are in Fitzroy."
280698,9710742,2014-01-06,224386,David,88,We stayed for 3 nights at the townhouse and it was a great place in a great location. It was completely faithful to the advertised description and pictures.

Our week at her tri-level architect designed townhouse felt like a month - so delightful a living space it was, with great separation, outdoor terraces, lovely light and warmth, and views over the rooftops of quirky Fitzroy. 
We walked and wandered everywhere, often popping back home to refresh and recharge, then walked out again to repeat the pleasure. Location location - having lived in Fitzroy in the distant past it was just perfect in every regard.
Ramona, you are a Treasure, we miss you and look forward to staying with you on our next visit. Thank you for everything."
74548,21221668,2014-10-13,1000988,David,95,"What a great host! When Mario found out this is not only my first trip to Melbourne and first trip to Australia , he took me in as one of his family. He invited me to dinner with his daughter and niece and nephew in law. After dinner he took us a walking tour of Melbourne . The location is very convenient . Tram station is around the corner and great restaurants all over. Victoria market is only 5 minutes walk. The view from his balcony is great. All in all a great introduction to Melbourne and Australia. "

Allen was very welcoming, easy to talk to, and made us feel at home. Allen's description of Tranquility in Melbourne is no lie, it's exactly how it felt. 

We wish him all the best and hope to stay in touch."
120487,859393,2012-01-13,1343699,David & Natalie,0,"We enjoyed our stay at Barbara's very much.   The property is a delight, with a large sunny garden surrounded by trees.   It is a very relaxing place to stay, yet close to shops, cafes, restaurants and transport.   A taste of suburban Melbourne, yet an easy journey to the heart of the city.

Our host was most welcoming, helpful and very friendly and we believe, provided a level of service above what we expected, with some wonderful, unexpected little touches.

The facilities are clean, comfortable and charming.   Your own little haven away from home!

Henry the dog is quiet and friendly, always ready for a pat, but gentle enough not to be a bother if you don't wish to interact with him.   A lovely dog indeed.

We have no hesitation recommending this accommodation as a great place to stay in wonderful Melbourne.   Barbara is a wonderful host.    We can't wait to return."

The lane way has a great new coffee shop ,meeting place and literally metres away is several great restaurants and coffee houses. Across the road is the GPO building and transport was easy.

She took care of me and my partner in a perfect way , giving us all the information, amenities and advises we need. She opened her house and we felt like home. Binoche (the cat) did fall in love with us and viceversa.

The accomodation was (Website hidden by Airbnb) much better than even the photos do justice!  I enjoyed the selection of organic breads and tea every morning and it felt like home away from home.

His incredibly charming home is in a fantastic tucked away location, yet in the thick of all that is Fitzroy/Collingwood.  Jack (the dog) and Amy (the cat) are both fantastic company, yet it was Alan and his generous, warm and engaging hospitality that really made this something special.  I stayed two nights, and by the second morning I genuinely felt like I was waking up in a friend's home. And it's to a friend's home that I hope to return one day. Thank you Alan."

Lulu took the time to make sure all our needs were met and questions answered. The space is rustic, homely and very comfortable, with all the facilities you could want. The wine in the fridge and the bountiful fruit bowl were surprise bonuses. Location, location! Literally surrounded by eateries and alternative shopping, along with handy reliables like supermarkets and chemists within a few minutes walk as well as being just a short tram ride into the city centre.

You will enjoy spotting all Ramona's collectables. :) Ramona herself is easy going, independent and respectful of privacy. She has lots of tips for things to see and do locally. The only drawback about staying here is that sometimes the neighbours can be a bit noisy, but that's just part of the character of the neighbourhood. Other than that, no faults. You should stay at Ramona's - it's a great place!"

The bed is very comfortable and the view of the gorgeous great gum tree outside makes the place very special! It is perfectly situated - far enough down the street to be quiet, but a very short walk to Brunswick Street, the cultural hub of Fitzroy, where there are heaps of eateries, pubs, bands and vintage clothes shops. We made Slowpoke ( just around the corner) our local cafe and the beginning of every day of exploring. The No 112 tram took us to the CBD and from there we could travel wherever we wished . Rebecca was so easy to deal with and we would highly recommend her apartment for anyone travelling to Melbourne for a holiday."

They were very welcoming, urging me to ""make myself at home"" at every opportunity. They were also great company, and we had some interesting and fun discussions - usually about food! The room is spacious and comfortable and despite facing the street I was not bothered by any traffic noise. I would definitely consider staying with Tania and Steve again, as they are great people, their house (and garden) is wonderful and the house is in a terrific location, close to public transport and parks."

Instantly we felt welcome and at home :) From explaining directions and transport to showing us around famous streets we had most definitely enjoyed our stay. We will miss their company and kindness. Diana is very friendly and caring, and Rob also has a great sense of humour (as well as being very talented at singing and playing guitar!) The house was indeed quiet as described and we spent each day comfortably.
Our trip to Melbourne was wonderful and one to remember.
We couldn't have asked for a better host :) Once again, thank you so very much.

We stayed in Eliisa's apartment for 5 months and it felt like 'home'. Both of us worked in the City so it was convenient for work and everything that the 'most liveable city' in the world has to offer.

We would recommend anyone to stay at Eliisa's apartment. We are both well into our 50's and yes, it can occasionally be a bit noisy with weekend revellers and the refuse trucks empty bins at stupid o'clock but it's a city apartment and the upside, for us, nicely balanced this out. If you are looking for tranquility, don't stay in the city.

Eliisa's lovely parents were also very helpful; nothing was ever too much trouble.

We are now back in the UK and are already missing Melbourne. I expect the cheeky sparrows are missing us; not exactly us but more their daily feed on the balcony "

Absolutely nothing disappointed us. The cottage itself was charming and convenient; simple, and with everything needed to relax, including a lovely deck on which you can relax and listen to the birds.  We left feeling relaxed and recharged, having thoroughly enjoyed the peace and beauty of the location and exploring its surrounds.  "

It was the little touches like bottle of water and cups by our bed and maps and lonely planet of melb etc.  If we are in Melbourne again without the kids we will definitely stay again if possible."

From my arrival Sharyn was extremely welcoming and friendly, I felt immediately comfortable. The bedrom was great with everything I needed including ample bed linen, towels , access to a well-facilitated bathroom and plenty of mirrors! There was a  great amount of privacy also. I had a fantastic one night stay right in the heart of Melbourne and easily found my way to where I needed, as Sharyn was also happy to help me in this regard. I definitely highly recommend this apartment to anyone who needs a bedroom and a bathroom in a central location. I dare say I will be returning here again in the future!

The location was perfect- close to great cafes and shops and a tram line that went through the CBD all the way to the beach.
We were very happy with our experience with Rebecca and her treehouse in Fitzroy."
247140,166894857,2017-07-05,133178297,Deborah,96,The nicest thing about our first AirBnB experience was the privacy and sense of security afforded at Fiona's apartment.  Great choices of bed coverings so we weren't too hot or cold. Nice not to be interrupted by hotel style chamber maids servicing rooms was another bonus we enjoyed. Tip:  keep bathroom doors closed at night as constant air conditioning in the bathrooms can dry your bedroom air out.  No noise btw.  Will definitely stay again.

Your accommodation was perfect for us in every way. Clean comfortable and close to Melbournes attractions with transport at the doorstep. No wonder your home is one of the busiest air bnb's in Melbourne.
283257,43489372,2015-08-20,7158389,Denise,99,"Love Michael and Lulu's hospitality at their quaint little home extension. They've extended their welcome with full kitchen necessities that my cousin and I couldn't have asked for more.

The home is right smack in the middle of cafes and shops, prefect for first-time Melbourne-Fitzroy visitors whom are looking for a feel of the place. The entrance to the home may be located at the end of the laneway, but it's still relatively safe to return at night.

Just one small little glitch, the second bedroom on the 3rd floor doesn't come with heater, so if you're going in winter like my cousin and I did, it could get pretty cold. So layer up when going to sleep at night!

Thank you again Lulu and Michael, hope to see you both again in the next round when we're in town."

The double bed was very comfortable with a cozy duvet (perfect for the chilly Melbourne nights) and a great selection of pillows - all of which ensured I had a great night's sleep.   The room is very quiet and Julie and her son Karl are quiet hosts.  Although I shared the bathroom with Karl, it was no trouble at all.   Julie and Karl made me feel at home, even if I was out and about for most of my time there.  I am happy to recommend Julie's lovely home to fellow airbnb guests/"

It's a cosy little home but it's a little out dated.. had dirty dishes in the kitchen cupboard but I mostly ate out. Also the carpets are kind of old carpet and smelt of cigarettes. The apartment is on a main road, so if you're a light sleeper the road noise might be a problem, but it wasn't for us."

Marios place is awesome and easily walkable to a number of Melbournes key places. If you get a chance go to Brunettis on Lygon street where they have some of the best pastries and coffee I've ever seen. (Try the ronstel cheesecake, top 3 cheesecakes I've had in life). The place is truly 5 (Hidden by Airbnb) posts waiting to happen. Fitzroy and Carlton are just around the corner with some of the most awesome coffee shops, cafes, and restaurants available as well as loads of art.

Karen was really friendly and accommodating and let us know about all the interesting events happening in the area during our stay. 

The cabin is really well located to Healesville, but just far enough away to feel really relaxed. 

We had a wonderful four nights in Chum Creek and would definitely go back! "

You can have your morning or evening walk to see sunrise or sunset. Everything you need are all there and a few spare just in case. They are so thoughtful in preparing the places for us. The carpark space was another great point for those who rent a car during their stay. checkin process is simple and fast. I would definitely go with their place again. 10/10.

268849,80452659,2016-06-18,2358015,Deyarn,100,"Mia's apartment was fantastic in every way! Super stylish, clean and cosy. Visiting from QLD, we anticipated we might struggle with the colder temps, but Mia's apartment kept us warm and comfortable. The amazing rain shower nozzle was also an unexpected bonus!

The location is brilliant.. only a few minutes walk to South Yarra Station and some wonderful restaurants and cafes. Great shopping in Chapel Street too. Mia's place is also only a few minutes walk to the Como Centre where Channel 10 films The Project. I'd highly recommend contacting the network to be a part of the studio audience if you're a fan of the show, especially given how close it is to Mia's apartment.

Having a hire care, we really valued the allocated parking space. Parking can hike up the bill when staying at regular accommodation so we really appreciated being able to stay in a gorgeous boutique apartment at a super reasonable rate which didn't attract a surcharge.

On a final note, Mia was a brilliant host! She maintained communication in advance of and during our stay. She was super helpful and promptly responded to any questions we had. We visited several of her restaurant/cafe recommendations and the food was amazing at all! Our Melbs friends were very impressed with our knowledge of all of the foodie hotspots - it was all thanks to Mia. I've already recommending the apartment to several friends since I've returned home. Thank you Mia! We loved our stay!"

Linda is a professional but relaxed and interesting hostess with the happy knack of making you truly welcome in her home.

On the practical side, the facilities in the apartment are top quality and spotless. The location is easily accessible to the Airport or CBD.

Malcolm and Tracey met us near the apartment entrance (we were later than expected but they were perfect hosts), Malcolm took us through all the workings of the apartment, showed us where everything was, told us where nearby supermarkets, cafes, about the travel card etc.   Apartment was beautifully furnished, was fully appointed and even had basics (cooking oil, teabags, sugar, sauces etc) in the pantry and milk, some jams etc in the fridge. Flowers, a bottle of wine and choccies also in the fridge was a lovely touch.  Tram stop 50 meters from the door made for easy travel around the city. A perfect place for your stay in Melbourne."

We got exactly that, plus a warm greeting from our hostess with the mostess--She offered us practical iPhone apps to navigate around the city, full access to her cosy and modern apt with great amenities, and to top it off was a total lifesaver when we got stranded due to flight cancellations. Thanks Camilla! See you next time we go through Melbourne :)"

Ramona's place was in a very central location with clear instructions how to get there from the airport as well as vital information regarding the local area.  It was relaxing, comfortable and quiet.

Ramona was extremely welcoming and friendly and went out of here way to make sure everything I needed was available, including advice on transportation and the city.

I would highly recommend staying at this location.  Romona is a great host with a memorable and chilled inner-city location.  The value is also worthwhile. 

5 star recommendation from me!"

It was immediately clear that Alan takes great enjoyment from having guests and that he loves showing off his city.  He was helpful in every way possible, and was very attentive to details.  Alan is very knowledgeable about his city, his country, and the world in general.  I enjoyed every moment of my time in Alan's home, and couldn't have had a better introduction to Australia."

Und auch diesmal habe ich nicht einmal darueber nachgedacht eine andere Unterkunft zu buchen. Ramona ist die Koenigin und die gute Seele vom Kiez (Fitzroy). Ihr kleines Haus und die mit viel Liebe zum Detail ausgewaehlte Inneneinrichtung macht diese Unterkunft zu etwas ganz besonderem. Leute - findet es heraus und ihr werdet nicht entaeuscht werden. So wie ich und nicht mehr genau wissen wie oft ihr schon da wart.

______________________________________________________

Few people know this Dylan song. They are either too young or too old and have forgotten it
But Ramona knows it (the Dylan song). Which made her instantly likeable to me. There is this little house in a small street in Fitzroy.
As the name already reveals: Little George Street.
With friendly neighbours and an open-minded, friendly, tolerant and educated host. Ramona.
A large room, an own balcony, study, and all to myself. And Fitzroy, not at all boring without being hectic.

72576,2885252,2012-11-15,24309,Dieter,99,"Why go back? For countless reasons: fine memories, or to find out whether it is as good as the first time around, etc. But the main reason is because the first trip was too short. Therefore it must have been great. Just like this time. Yet another reason to go back."

150729,4965478,2013-06-04,5990837,Dillon,98,"Ramona is an absolute legend and takes the idea of 'BnB' to the next level.  You instantly feel at home, which is not coincidence (Ramona clearly works very hard to create a comfortable space).  The house is beautiful and each room has its own character.  She is full of information and has a contagious love for Melbourne.  

Great hospitality aside, the house is in an amazing neighborhood.  There are infinite eateries and even more lattes to be sipped nearby.  Close to the city, but with a small community feel.

Will definitely stay again!"
280698,439384294,2019-04-19,31454685,Dimitra,100,Exactly as seen in the photos. This property has everything needed for a comfortable stay. Quiet block of townhouses with fantastic cafe next door and an easy walk to the beach. We found the tram into city a bit slow - it takes half hour to get in. You do have the option of catching the train in from Balaclava. The station is a ten minute walk away and takes only about 10 mins to get in. Overall this is a great spot and we highly recommend it.

His house is one of the best decorated house I've ever seen. Every inch has been meticulously decorated. We were there for a short time and didn't get to enjoy most of what the house offered but there's everything you could want in a rental. This is one of the few properties I've stayed in where the place is better than the pictures. The place was extremely comfortable and clean. Everything was provided for. He has a dog, Romeo. Romeo is one of the most well behaved dogs . I love dogs and own one myself so I wouldn't have had any problems with him anyway but if you're someone that doesn't like dogs, you can be rest assured that he will stay out of your way. Beadies why would you want such an amazing dog to stay out of your way. In any case, feel free to make any requests with Ryan. He's one of the most accomodaing hosts I've come across and I've no doubt he'll do anything he can to accommodate you. Thank you once again Ryan for a relaxing stay."

I stayed in the third floor and everything was exactly as described. The house is meticulously clean and has a very stylish and arty feel to it.
I arrived late on a hot summer day and there was ice water waiting for me in my room. Really thoughtful and just a nice start of my stay.
I messaged Ramona and got some great tips for local restaurants - best Pizza I had so far in Australia (since 7 years!)
The location is great - only short walks to bars and restaurants.
Overall: great location, great house , great host. What more do you want?

240410,146192586,2017-04-21,25012156,Dominic,99,Great little comfortable apartment in a beautiful area. Close to funky bars and the city. Neil was a pleasure to deal with. Rufus the cat was a lovely addition to the sunlit garden courtyard.
268849,34101027,2015-06-04,25235681,Dominic,98,"Mia is a fantastic host & her apartment is gorgeous. I have to disagree with an earlier post about the noise, yes there is building work happening nearby at the moment but the flat is totally soundproof, there was complete silence at all times, it wasn't an issue at all, and the view is still fantastic. The flat was spotless & very stylishly decorated, Mia met me with the key & it was past midnight when I arrived, she couldn't have been more helpful, & the secure parking was fantastic & easy to manouvre into, even with a larger car. Great caf√©s, shops & restaurants at your feet, 5 stars! Highly recommended."

Das Apartment war super zentral in Fitzroy, sehr sauber und gepflegt und wundersch√∂n eingerichtet, also genau wie beschrieben.
Durch die eigene Etage war sowohl absolute Privatsph√§re als auch gro√üz√ºgiger Wohnbereich durch das Schlafzimmer, ein eigenes Bad und den Galeriebereich gegeben.
Besonders hervor zu heben war das liebevolle Fr√ºhst√ºck, welches Ramona mit anbietet mit frischen Backwaren aus ihrer B√§ckerei,  Marmeladen, frischem Saft und Tee !
Absolut empfehlenswert ! ! !

The house is really nice, beautiful in the morning and evening, great space. Next time I would go ahead and book the larger room even.

Highly recommend!"

The apartment is on the top floor and is quiet and comfortable. It is very well equipped with everything you will need. We booked it for overseas friends and will definitely book again when others come to Melbourne.
A lovely local shopping centre is 5 minutes away with coffee places a small supermarket a bar and a chemist. Everything you could need.
Thanks for everything,

I spent a few great days while staying at his place, with a good size  bedroom and a comfy single bed, with private en-suite bathroom. The apartment block also has a tennis court, swimming pool, spa and sauna on the 7th floor for guests' use. I can highly recommend Mario as an ideal host. "
133617,62839848,2016-02-17,3222924,Dong,0,"LOCATION: Hannah's apartment was practically right off of Port Melbourne (hence the really windy streets). The walk from her apartment to the city center took about an hour. An alternative way was taking the tram from Port Melbourne (tram 96, with the station a little walking distance to the apartment) to the city center. 10 minutes away were a great collection of coffee shops, restaurants, bars, convenience stores, and supermarkets. For my family, who didn't mind the walking, it was as convenient as any place in the city center but at a much more reasonable price. On another note, the location was also within just several turns of getting on the M1 highway for anyone wishing to drive towards the Great Ocean Road from Melbourne. Parking space was available around the streets for free, so this may be something to keep in mind if you are coming with a car.

APARTMENT: My parents and I (a party of 3) had the master bedroom with a private bathroom. There was a queen-sized bed and a single-bed in the bedroom, and the room itself was very spacious with plenty of short-term storage space. Everything was maintained quite cleanly. The (very big!) living room and kitchen space was shared with Hannah, and Hannah was very open about us using her amenities. There was also a great patio/balcony area outside the apartment. 

RECEPTION: Hannah stayed in the smaller bedroom in the apartment with us. She was a great host. Before arrival, she ensured constant and effective communication to let us know the times she would be home. After arrival, she gave us great tips about getting in and out of the city of Melbourne, and about the Great Ocean Road. Hannah was a very welcoming person and fun person to talk to. She had a constant stream of guests, but when we had to store our luggage for a couple more hours on the day that we left, she was also very cool with it. It was generally a great experience staying with Hannah!

Located right in the very heart of Fitzroy, Ramona's place is within walking distance to a wide range of restaurants & cafes, live music bars, boutiques, parks and museums. It's also the perfect spot for anyone wanting to see some  amazing street art and meet interesting people with art and musical inclinations.  I highly recommend Ramona's place if you want to experience the true rhythm of Melbourne. "

His warm and cosy apartment oozed charm and was filled with art and books. The location was a tram stop away from everything. Lygon Street, The Yarra, the Bourke Street Mall and Little Collins Street. Malcome made us very welcome with Myki cards and a lovely bottle of wine. We loved it and I will be back again soon. Thanks again Malcome."

Used both of these whilst at Marios and they were spotless, location was perfect for my conference and accommodation had a friendly host who went out of his way to make our dinner reservations at Movida perfect. Thank you for that Mario we will be back to Movida for sure. Felt safe and respected at the apartment which had great views, only thing I didn't take was a hair dryer. Good first experience lets hope London and Paris are the same, Donna."
72576,434439,2011-08-10,40901,Donna,96,"This is a beautifully designed and decorated space in Fitzroy, Melbourne's most interesting neighbourhood. You'll be close to great bars, cafes, restaurants and shops, and a short walk or tram ride from the city. The room itself is light and lovely, with a particularly luxurious bed. The house setup gives you a perfect combination of privacy and company. Ramona is a wonderful host who knows and loves the city well and has a great sense of style. Her welcome is genuinely warm and she is flexible and communicative. "

The street is relatively quiet and the building is quite safe and secure. The apartment itself has everything needed and has a delightfully cosy appeal. Spotlessly clean too. Danielle managed to organise my stay (with the help of her husband) at the last minute which was terrific. Thanks for going the extra mile (:

257149,28660812,2015-03-28,1030042,Doug,93,"My wife and I had a brilliant stay at Lanie's Thornbury apartment with our two young boys. Lanie not only made it very easy to get in, but has left a comprehensive guide with everything you need to know about the area, complete with directions and detailed descriptions of local restaurants, cafes, shops, laundromats, grocery stores, supermarkets, taxi services etc, etc... VERY useful - especially when you're travelling with a 4 year old and toddler and don't have forever to wander around.
It's a great area - the apartment is walking distance to a High Street that has some terrific shops and places to eat. Good access to public transport into the city as well.
The apartment itself was perfect for our trip - the description photos provided by Lanie are accurate and give a good sense of the place.
Would highly recommend this place to anyone - we'd definitely stay again.
Doug.

Tracy and Malcolm met me in the morning when I arrived all bleary-eyed after a long trip and I was in my room before ten o'clock.

The suburbs of St Kilda itself is an amazing place to stay, very close to bustling Chapel Street if you want to do shopping or a short walk to the beach if you want to enjoy the ocean!

331605,54699477,2015-11-23,41218326,E-Leen,88,"Dina was helpful and responsive with regards to obtaining my check-in details earlier as I was on another overseas trip prior to visiting Melbourne. She was also really kind and arranged for an early check-in, since I was travelling with three children, at no extra charge.

The house is fully equipped and is in a really convenient area. The place was clean, sheets and towels were also very clean. It was also very spacious and had a nice view of the city.

One setback was that the carpark height limit was 2.1m but the mini bus my family rented was 2.3m, so big families renting mini buses might want to take note of this. However, there is a big open air carpark right behind the apartment so this isn't a really big issue.

The beds and pillows were really, really soft and my back hurt after D1 and I had to stack 3 pillows together to be comfortable. Bedroom 2 & 3 had no ventilation or air conditioning. This would have been fine if we opened the window, but the apartment was on a high floor and with three children, opening the windows was not an option. My message to Dina about this did not receive a reply though.

While doing the laundry, we realised it took a really long time to dry our clothes in the dryer. Upon further inspection, we realised that the lint build up was so thick that the dryer wasn't properly ventilated. In the end we had to climb up and remove the lint by ourselves, which shows that there might be a little maintenance neglect. But the dryer worked just fine after that.

Also, the conceige wasn't at the lobby when I arrived so I had to use my phone to call, which means roaming charges apply. The number was invalid though. Someone was kind enough to let us into the lobby to wait for the conceige and out of the cold. Conceige was really helpful with the check in and also helped us hold on to a package which was meant to arrive on the last day of our stay but did not, so we picked up the package 3 days later when we returned to the city.

Overall, this apartment is really worth the price. I will not hesitate to stay with Dina again if I ever return to Melbourne."

10803,66549908,2016-03-23,26006816,Ed,100,"Lindsay was a great host. Although he was not there when we arrived, he kept great communication prior to our arrival and made sure we knew how to get in to his very interesting, yet charming apartment. He arrived shortly after us getting in and answered our questions about the area, the city, etc. 

Brunswick East is a great spot, and Lindsays place is literally on the tram line that goes to the city centre, which is very handy, and not far from  some excellent bars and cafes - the pub across the road is really good, some great beer and live music.

Lindsay allowed us to extend our stay for an additional 4 nights, and also picked up mail for us after our stay had finished so that we could pop back and collect it. He stays out of your business, is very respectful of privacy and is very welcoming, allowing us to live in the flat as if it were your own home for your stay. Top host!"
108032,18120160,2014-08-22,10722388,Ed,91,"We flew in and took a bus to the Spencer St Station and were met by Malcolm on Collins St near the apartment entrance.  He showed us all of the basics and was engaging and enjoyable.  In a short time he left us.  The first thing about this apartment is location, location.  I can't imagine a better place to be when visiting Melbourne.  We were able to walk or take a tram everywhere we wished to go - and we were out quite a lot!  The area is full of interesting cafes, restaurants, art galleries, clothes shops and a huge variety of shops.  We found the apartment a very good place to rest.  The kitchen was quite adequate with a two burner stove, an oven and microwave and a small but adequate fridge.  Nearby is a  Coles for food and a bottle shop.  We are in our early 70s and we found the bed comfortable.  The TV was fine but the DVD collection is in need of some editing.  One DVD we selected would not play in the region and another broke up and ended before the end of the film.  The TV faces a comfy lounge area with a range of books and DVDs.  The dining table, a good usable table, is at the end of the bed with two low stools without backs.  It is quite adequate but a bit uncomfortable after a while.  Over all the decor we found quite enjoyable and we felt immediately at home.  The bathroom is excellent with a very good shower.  The building is well soundproofed between apartments there is no sound but we were aware of some street noise at night.  We live in the country so we are not used to noise at night.  In summary the apartment is excellent.  The location is excellent.  Melbourne is the culture capital of Australia (my opinion) and this apartment is in the midst of much that Melbourne has to offer.

The apartment has an reasonable size, a well-equipped kitchen and a warm and comfortable bedroom. We really felt like we were at home.

The only ""bad"" thing, that didn't change my overall satisfaction, was the bathroom where the hot water can run out if you are in two or more people."

The room was perfect! There was plenty of light in my private ensuite room which overlooked the dining room.

air conditioning is a fan ..
his son cries for a long time. and how it ended .. the accommodation I found was much better! airbnb refunded me the trip completely excluded the days actually stayed.

ho contattato Shrley a ottobre/novembre x un soggiorno di 1 mese e 1 settimana in Melbourne x me mio marito e mia figlia. la signora mi mandava la richiesta di prenotazione con un importo ben preciso che io ho pagato.. invece dopo ben 4 giorni che soggiornavamo da lei mi chiede soldi extra per la bambina perch√© diceva che le aumentava i consumi! una bambina di due anni che consumi vuoi che dia?!?! ovviamente non ho acconsentito il risultato √® stato che mi ha buttato fuori di casa con una bambina di 2 anni tra l altro malata, me incinta e malata. dicendolo all'una di notte con check-out la mattIna alle ore 11! le foto della camera erano diverse da quella assegnata, stanza piccola e molto cAlda.

What an amazing woman with so much warmth, energy and life experience. I stayed up watching renovation shows with her and relishing her company. Linda's home is just beautiful and the pictures do not do it justice. Rapt with my experience and meeting an inspirational woman along the way. Thank you Linda for welcoming me into your home. "

The room was very private and comfortable and my Dad felt very comfortable there. He had a great time looking through Walter's amazing book collection! The house has a lovely relaxed feeling and it was easy to get to public transport from there so it was also quite convenient. Northcote is a great area to stay in and there are lots of little hidden cafes and parks in the surrounding suburban streets.

268849,214919681,2017-11-26,26870671,Elizabete,98,"A super stylish apartment! A perfect home away from home in Melbourne. The location is super good and really close to the city centre.

Mia was a great host and always kept in touch to make sure we were finding everything ok. Overall, super good communication, albeit the details regarding check-in and check-out arrangements could have been provided earlier.

The apartment has all the amenities you would need. The terrace was especially nice to sit out in and enjoy a glass of champagne in!

One downside is that there was significant wear and tear on some of the furniture such as the couch and the armchair. Also, the photos show the apartment having more decorative pieces than there are in reality. Nevertheless, we still adored this apartment and would 100% recommend it to anyone!"
51592,281472069,2018-06-25,149456335,Elizabeth,93,"A truly unique place to stay right in the heart of all things Melbourne CBD laneway action.  Travelers that value a place with local character, both in an outside of their rented space, will love this.  It is the antidote to the ""same-as-the-next"" hotel rooms and rentals that are so sterile.  

This home is a lived-in but low-clutter space--a huge, repurposed warehouse with some industrial fixtures (winches, etc.) still in situ.  Where else do you get a 20 foot ceiling in your huge rainforest bath?  Super comfortable place to curl up with a good book or glass of wine gazing at the two faces of the colorfully lit GPO clocktower outside the huge windows.

Alas, you may not spend long in it as it is in the middle of where you want to be--mere moments from ace cafes, restaurants (city's best pasta joint; great ramen, dumplings) and bars.  

Michelle is an A+ host.  Super responsive, she was generously flexible re check-in.  And as a travel publisher in her own right,  she has her finger on the pulse of what's hot.  Every one of her food and drink recommendations was a winner! (Read her online rec's and her newly published eat and drink ""card sets.""   Recommended without hesitation to those who want a best-of-Melbourne-laneways experience.  Would return in a heartbeat."

Ramona is the perfect host - delightful, charming and helpful whose home with its clean lines and creative design affords guests the perfect space and privacy in their own ‚Äòloft apartment‚Äô- all in a part of Melbourne that is vibrant and central.

Close to the best things Melbourne has to offer, (namely, out two hosts), we enjoyed every minute of our stay and their many great suggestions about what to see and do while in town.

She provided everything we could need (and more) including calling us a very early morning cab to the airport and providing excellent restaurant recommendations in the neighborhood. Her home is beautiful and very comfortable, with anything that you could need for your stay (including delicious tea and baked goods, laundry facilities, fresh cut flowers, and an extensive movie collection).  The Fitzroy neighborhood is lots of fun and wonderfully located for exploring Melbourne.  I would highly recommend staying here!"

I enjoyed seeing what good parents they are to their little boy James, and I also had fun taking their lovely dog Sugar for a walk.  I would be happy to go back to their house in the future.  The room is at the back of the house and away from the busy road in front of the house, which was an advantage for someone like me who's used to a quiet neighbourhood.  Good value for money and an interesting suburb to explore."

Although the location was a little out of the way, for the price and the beautiful comfortable stay we had it was worth it and it was definitely convenient for us since we drove. Ryan made sure he was home when we arrived and gave us a great introduction to the house, orientations us. He also provided lots of information and recommendations that helped to enhance our experience of Melbourne. We had fun playing with their big friendly dog, Romeo. Their house is decorated with such great taste that I felt like I was living in a celebrity home. Would definitely come back if I could!"

Fitzroy is definitely one of the more interesting places in Melbourne with lots going on, great caf√©s, shops, restaurants, community street stalls....but Ramona's home is a quiet comfortable haven. We will have to return to be able to use all her cafe and restaurant tips. Friendly, comfortable, helpful and a great location, everything that you could want. We will recommend staying with Ramona to our friends."
74959,13636853,2014-06-01,15506896,Elizabeth,0,"Well!!....where to begin.  Right from the moment I knocked on Linda's front door she made me feel not just like a boarder in her home but a very welcome guest.  Linda was  warm and friendly and had a wealth of information on where everything was in the area.  Linda's luxurious home was a welcome haven and a treat to come back to each day.  Never a Hotel again for me when I'm in Melbourne..... it will always be at Linda's beautiful comfortable first class home!!
Oh... and I mustn't forget ""Buddy"" who never says no to a walk along the glorious beach front just metres from your doorstep if you're up for it. Libby

51592,242720752,2018-03-12,93713888,Ella,100,"This was our first Air BnB experience and we were glad we got Michelle as our host. The location was amazing - walking distance to the great cafes, restaurants and shops, but the actual space of the apartment was what was outstanding, so different and unique. The skyline from the huge windows had a really beautiful view. What you see in the pictures is exactly what you get. We would return again if ever in Melbourne and would recommend this to anyone. Don't think twice :)
PS: The swing adds a really interesting touch to the feel of the apartment!
If I had to have one critique - that would be that the bed was too soft - I perfer a harder bed, but that's just me.
Overall - well worth the money......"

280698,345377699,2018-11-04,28655252,Ellen,98,"We had a faulty GPS & were driving in circles looking for the place. When we called we were able to find it right away and we appreciated how the hosts were so readily available.  The biggest shower in our three week trip with nice water pressure. Locked gated parking was great for being in the city. Really good window coverings, considering the large windows; it definitely added to the privacy. Restaurants and supermarkets close by. Be sure to bring breakfast foods or eat right around the corner."

We felt we could make ourselves comfortable and could happily use all the amenities at our leisure. Ramona is a very welcoming, friendly host, with heaps of info on the area and advice on the best places to eat. We also found that as we had our own level, there was heaps of privacy too. The perfect location to catch trams into the city, docklands or even walk to great cafe's and restaurants. We even had an i-pod dock, umbrella's and hair dryer for all the small comforts we tend to forget on holidays. I would highly recommend staying here, and will definitely be returning to Ramona's great place in Fitzroy!"

Ramona's place is just as you see in the pics and as others describe, perfect. Ramona's tips and manual were ideal for us. We had the top level, excellent. Great location, we walked, ate, drank our way around Fitzroy. You are 5 mins walk from the free city transport limit, fantastic system. Highlights were Smith and Daughters, Best veggie food ever. The Napier pub, Little Creatures, Gelato Messina has migrated well from Sydney too. Chin Chin in Flinders Lane $69 dining experience is one of the best meals ever as well, great way to spend a few rainy hours in Melbourne! we'll be back! "

The accommodation is in an ideal location, walking distance to everything.

Ramona made us feel very welcome. We did appreciate the delicious bread loaves, tea and condiments that we could help ourselves to. 

My husband and I can certainly recommend this place.

Vince and Frank provided a lot of detail to access the property and promptly responded to any questions we had. 

However, definitely would not recommend this property if required for use of sofa bed. Sofa is a single, uncomfortable and only a (very stained/dirty) blanked is provided... No quilt. 

There is also limited hot water for showers."

The apartment is located at less than 5 min to Bridge Road which is a dynamic street of Richmond full of lovely restaurants, fashion shops, and convenience stores. Moreover the tram 48, 75 was also at a 5 min walk (10 min walk for the 109) which take you directly to the city. The location is thus ideal.
The apartment was nice, clean, tidy and had all the kitchen equipment you need. The bathroom was clean and very convenient. Frank and Vince were friendly and had organised everything for my parents' arrival. 
I highly recommend this place for your staying."

We were amazed to see the generous breakfast waiting for us on the table in the morning, what a great way to start your day ! The only thing we regret is not having spent enough time chating with Walter because of our busy days.
Highly recommend this host !!!"

The owner Mia had an interesting collection of books as well as a very well-stocked kitchen and she had already prepared a high speed portable Telstra wifi router for us before our stay. She was extremely helpful and helped to answer all our queries (including where I could get accessories for my wedding photoshoot) within a very short time and made it very pleasurable stay.

Although accommodation is a room in her home,  she succeeds in making you feel very relaxed and comfortable. She is a genuine hostess. Her recommendations for places to eat  and visit were fantastic. Good value for money,  close to Melbourne Centre.  Some noise from road traffic below,  but double glazing and fan sorts that out. She was very flexible with checkout time to fit in with our flights."

He has lots of interesting stories from his travels and is also very knowledgeable of many things about Melbourne. - oh, and he's a good cook, too!

Alan's pets are just adorable. Jack is very playful and he loved keeping me company (and warm) - Amy too!

The house is really clean and beautiful; and the room is sunny and has a nice view of Alan's wonderful front garden. The place is really quiet, and yet lots of shops, cafes, and interesting places are just walking distance. The tram stop is also just a few steps away.

Loved every moment of my stay. :)"

281890,287242102,2018-07-08,164988500,Emily,100,"I don‚Äôt think I can put into words how much I loved my stay here!!! Best Air BnB in Melbourne by a mile. The family are just wonderful, and as a solo traveller they soon felt like my own Aussie family! Incredibly friendly and helpful, they have so many local recommendations and tips. The description is very true, you can get involved as much or little as you like in the daily family fun - I threw myself right in and had so much fun with the kids Bella and Aus, plus chatting away to Karen and Jim in the evenings. The house is beautiful, incredibly stylish and clean - but not so spotless you‚Äôd feel uncomfortable or unable to relax. It‚Äôs located in a lovely inner suburb, so peaceful and very safe. It took me only 10 mins to walk to the station and then a 20 min train right into the city centre - ideal! My bedroom was huge and spacious, with really nice bedsheets and a little mini fridge. There‚Äôs also room in the kitchen fridge and drawers to store food. I miss staying here already and would go back over and over and over. Thank you for everything the wonderful Williams!!!"

Sugar is so sweet and loves a good pat. Most lovely people, relaxed and helpful. Always had breakfast things laid out for me in the morning. Private separate room out the back with a good heater (it was so cold in Melbourne at the time!) and comfy pillows on the bed. Good access into the city from the train, about a 8 minute walk to the station and about a $25 taxi from the city otherwise. Nice area to stay in and a good base. Would definitely stay again!

It was any easy decision to choose Alan, he had so many positive reviews on the site - and my stay lived up to everything I hoped it would. 

Alan embodies what Air BnB is all about, he opens his house up and invites you in with open arms.  We had a lovely dinner together, and Alan was super kind offering me lifts to various places such as the train station and even a friend‚Äôs house on Friday night. I wouldn‚Äôt hesitate to recommend Alan and definitely hope to stay here again! 

Also the bed and pillow are so comfy. Just divine.

Living in her house is like a little adventure. The yellow vintage car with red roses decorated inside was absolutely beautiful , even tableware were special collections.I‚Äôm going to stop here now,I‚Äôll leave you to find out those remaining surprises.
By the way,the place is located in the district that has many interesting stores and good restaurants,cafes. 

The host, Ramona is probably the nicest person in the world(yes, I‚Äôll give her that). She‚Äôs so gentle and patient, and gave us a lot of good advice in terms of our trip. Her fridge contains a good variety of food.  Btw, I loved her music taste;)
 
All in all, I really enjoyed the three days living in her house. It was a great pleasure to know Ramona. And  I‚Äôm sure I will revisit this place next time when I come to Melbourne."
244952,116812968,2016-12-03,50479913,Eric,95,"Rebecca's place in Fitzroy was exactly as described. An added bonus were the number of friendly cats around her neighborhood, which  I enjoyed patting each morning on my way to my work meetings. Check in was a breeze and Rebecca even let me store my bags earlier than the set check in time! I'm thus happy to give her place a thumbs up and a positive review!"
150729,336897132,2018-10-15,27414088,Eric,0,This will be one of the best stays you have. Location is perfect. The host loves her neighborhood and her local tips are very spot on. The bed is comfy. Extra touches are very nice. It's a great place to stay if you are a night owl or early riser.

It's lovely and quiet, and Julie herself was very friendly and hospitable! We also discovered that Prahran is an incredible neighborhood, sporting a wonderful array of shops, cafes, and restaurants. It's proximity to the tennis and CBD (less than 10 minutes away via train) was also a big plus!"

The location of the apartment is perfect, just a short walk from the tram, close to the city. The whole house is beautifully decorated with stylish, quality furniture. Beautiful, very clean, and quiet. The bed in the guestroom is very comfortable, fells like in a 5-star hotel.  Very nice, new, clean bathroom with quality shower.
Linda provided me everything and her home became a home away from home for me. I enjoyed every moment of my stay at her place. This is really a luxurious home and well worth the price. 
Linda is a wonderful person with full of heart and shine. She is truly the most wonderful host I have ever met!!! I cannot recommend her and her home enough!!!! Staying with her was a real life-time experience for me. Her home is one of the best places in Melbourne, warm, cosy and welcoming.

Not only was my room great, but the neighborhood is ideal for getting your barings in Melbourne, plus it's near tons of great restaurants, cafes, bars, and shopping. Also, Ramona provided me with maps, guide books, a bus/tram card, and yummy treats, and she always made herself available if I needed her. Loved my time here and can't wait to come back!"

The apartment couldn't be better situated in Melbourne - the neighbourhood is lively and we felt right at home amongst the fruit vendors, in the cafes, in the wonderful natural food store and at the organic food coop. I can't recommend the area more highly, nor can I imagine a better place to land at the end of a long day, or to hang out and work. We were in Melbourne to do both, and will happily return to the same place next fall. Thank you!"

The beds were comfy and made up with really lovely quality linen.
Lanie and Shaun communicated with us well and even left a bottle of bubbly in the fridge to celebrate. 
The flat was full of a great selection of books and decorations, which I would have loved to have more time to read!!

Their newly-purchased flat is adorable...clean and comfortable and tres chic, and super convenient -- it's right next to the tram, pubs, and restaurants, and only 10 or 15 mins straight into the CBD.  If you're looking for someplace to stay in Melbourne with a homey feel and friendly locals, you won't find a better place than Loren and Ruth's Richmond digs."
51592,55147495,2015-11-28,49082307,Erin,0,Michelle made us feel super welcome and had some amazing recommendations for places for us to eat and drink while staying in Melbourne. The fact that the only reason we were staying in Melbourne was to eat and drink so we were very happy chappys. Amazing spacious apartment and so close to everything. We could walk anywhere easily and stopped by the cafe just downstairs every morning for a delicious brew. We also may have gotten a cheeky tattoo from the tattoo parlour downstairs. Have recommended the apartment to family and friends and we cannot wait to stay there again on our next trip to Melbourne! 
43429,3437984,2013-01-29,2156684,Erin,91,"My boyfriend and I had a great stay in Allan's studio. It was very clean, stylish and well set up.

I would definitely recommend this place to others."
244952,29099014,2015-04-04,6067305,Erin,98,Rebecca was an excellent host. She left very easy instructions and the apartment was very clean and tidy. I would recommend to anyone visiting Melbourne who wants a location close to the city and many restaurants and bars.

Vince and Frank responded to all communication very promptly, and they went above and beyond to help cater for some extra needs of mine due to health, as well as taking the time to suggest some great local cafes to visit :) 
We had a great time exploring Melbourne from this apartment!! Thanks!!
(P.S: The goat curry from the Nepali Gurkha in Bridge St is stupidly good. Yummm!)

Nicht jeder Teilnehmer kann genau an dem Punkt ""abgeholt"" werden, an dem er dazulernt, das ist klar. So war die erste Stunde eher mit Basiswissen wie Kameraeinstellung etc. belegt. Auf meine Bitte, doch ein bisschen mehr auf Bildgestaltung, Kreativit√§t etc. einzugehen, schaltete Jerry sofort um, und dann wurde es f√ºr mich richtig interessant. Leider haben wir die Tourismush√∂lle Fishermans Wharf die ganzen 3,5 Stunden nicht verlassen, so dass mit ""hidden treasures"" nichts zu holen war. Deshalb auch keine f√ºnf Sterne.

10803,129268632,2017-01-29,803565,Erwin,94,"Lindsay is a great host and this room is in an ideal location (across the street from a tram stop that runs frequently... even all night on weekends!). I'd definitely stay here again.

There's a cafe downstairs (Awkward Mike's) run by some charming guys, but you can skip the pizzeria next door (though it works for late night dining -- open til 11pm). Milkwood (cafe restaurant down Nicholson) and New Day Rising (on Blyth) are also great. There's a small convenience store (including alcohol) across Nicholson.

Keep in mind that there is a live music venue across the street, so if you're a light sleeper this might keep you up.

Being at an intersection, there were times when fumes idling at the traffic light would seep into the room, so this is something to keep in mind for people with respiratory issues."

We really enjoyed a great week here and would recommend Ramona and her location without any reservation!
Indeed: If we ever come to Melbourne again - and a lot of good reasons would favor that idea -, Ramons place will definitely be our number one address! We were just happy here.

The sunny space got quite warm in the afternoons, but the ceiling fan and open windows were enough to keep it comfortable. It's a cute quiet neighborhood, with a few cafes and pubs right nearby and public transit and livelier streets not too far away, not to mention the river path access as well. It was a little weird having to lock/unlock the door from inside using the key, but it was not much of a problem. "

The location is so perfect that you can reach to city by 10mins walk or tram to easily access / walking through Brunkswick St. also quiet interesting. You will find all the funky stuffs not far from Romona's.  
Romona's hospitality was super impressive. She communicated us so well that I felt , she is much better than any other 5 star hotels conceirges. She provided me  not only information of Fitzroy & city of Melbourne but also tour info as well, extremely helpful.

Her place is in a very luxury building and her apartment has a lot of windows and provides such a nice view. Everything is clean and neat. The room and the bed was just great. We totally would recommend her place and would come back again.

It was above and beyond all expectations, in every way. The house is spotless and gorgeous, in a fabulous neighborhood, with an amazingly lovely host.  Ramona provides beautiful breakfast goods and lovely conversation (if you're lucky enough to catch her at home), plenty of space to ""do your thing,"" and great tips on eating, drinking, and things to see/do around town. The house is full of all sorts of thoughtful touches for her guests. Ramona will be the first person I look up when I return to Melbourne. It made my short visit (which came at the end of a long, tiring work trip) feel comfortable and relaxed, and gave me a great feel for what this city is all about. It truly felt like a home away from home. Thank you, Ramona! I'm already looking forward to next time!"

The space felt like home while also affording privacy.  The space was clean, superbly decorated, and had wonderful sunlight throughout the living areas.  We really enjoyed the ""say hi and bye when entering and leaving"" :).   We were able to walk to everything in Fitzroy and, having rented a car, we could drive quickly into any other neighborhood.  "

The accommodation was fantastic and we really appreciated the extras such as real coffee and breakfast.  The raisin toast was delicous.  My traveling partner is going to also join AirBnB as she does alot of travel for her work and was really impressed.

Situated in the heart of spirit-filled Fitzroy, it's a 2 minute walk to great cafes, pubs, and cocktail bars. You can stroll and explore, or consult with Ramona's curated list of recommendations (we tried that and her list was spot on!). 

The house itself is lovely - beautifully decorated, spacious and bright. Wish we had more time to spend in it :)"

215787,120954101,2016-12-12,28227770,Evrim,99,"Very nice house, walking distance to CBD and Church St. You can also get tram to places like the Docklands and Balaclava. Punt Road is busy 7/24, if you are too sensitive about traffic noise, this can be an issue, but the bedroom can keep most of it away.
If you think about hiring a car throughout your stay, the carpark will come handy. The place is the hub of the motorways (As mentioned above, Punt Road), so it's easy to be on track to wherever you may wish to go (from Dandenong to St. Kilda). 
Laundry facilities are currently lacking, but there is a laundromat (very clean and cozy) close by. 
Marilyn is a helpful host and will do her best to resolve whatever issues you may have if you are open about them. All of the information in the description is accurate too."

209073,1265477,2012-05-12,483895,Eyesha,97,"We stayed in Oscar's apartment from May3-11, 2012. The apartment is i a great loction close to CBD. But overall, our stay wasn't that great. Oscar promised to provide with wireless internet, but there wasn't any kind of service through out our stay. He kept saying that there is some technical problem, but it seemed as if he wanted not provide with this facility. Secondly, we had paid for till the 11th, and had requested for a little late check out on the 11th, and Oscar had accepted it. But when the time came, he sent me a message on the 10th that we were supposed to check out today but he is allowing us to stay an extra night to make up for the internet!! I think he needs to check his calendar and conversations seriously...
Thirdly, on the last night..rather the last morning on the 11th of May, someone tried to unlock the main door at 6:00 am. Luckily enough,we were awake, and got to the door, and my husband managed not to let the person unlock it completely...but this episode for sure ran cold within us...when told, Oscar said that it would be an accident..someone trying to open the wrong door..but the question is can you unlock every door with one key? ofcourse not... the person at the door ""had half unlocked"" the door..with a wrong key???? 
we were so scared, that we left the aparttment at the regualr check out time.... what a way to get your apatment back.... 
Besides all this, the apartment is toooooo stuffy...and if you are looking to relax a bit and cook even a little bit, this is not for you....you won't find any place for you stuff, and you will have to be exteremly careful not to dislocat, break something while daily routines.....
I am sorry to say, but next time I will rather book a hotel... my first and last experience with Airbnb was ruined completely........."

The place is located in a lane way near cafes and restaurants, so pretty much you are right near everything but at the same time you have your own privacy. The inside of the place was amazing, so spacious and modern with a vintage feel. Upstairs had the bedrooms (2) which were very tidy and neat, the king bed was very comfortable and the rooms were large with enough wardrobe space. They made sure that every room had a air con and heater which was a great touch! The bathroom was big and lighted. We had the best time in this stay, loved the burger joint next door too :) frank and Vince were very flexible and down to earth, would recommend anyone to stay at their place. Thanks guys"

We drank tea and discuss tea culture also tea ceremony from China. We talked about trading, as well as spiritual and emotional world. He also helped us to correct our spoken English! John is a man full of wisdom. 
The house is equipped with all living essentials, what you need is just to ask John, and he has pretty much everything that you can think of.
But people who are scared of social activity may find him a little too chatty. No offense.
But for me and my wife, it is a really nice and worthy stay in his house.
The supermarket and train station is in walking distance. The train goes to city center. The road in front of the house is a main road, and makes driving very convenient. 
Above all, we strongly recommend it to everyone who want a real Airbnb style stay in Melbourne."

It also comes with all the materials you need to find your way around. 

I can't say much about public transportation as I was driving but the house seem to be 15 - 20 minutes to get to the nearest supermarket. (Best is to rent a vehicle.) 

Ryan was friendly, kind and very welcoming. I enjoyed my stay there! 

Definitely a good place to stay in Melbourne. "

As a host Ramona was great; giving us plenty of time and space to ourselves, but offering fantastic advice whenever we needed it on the best places to go and things to do in the area, an incredible local insight.

We absolutely loved staying here and look forward to coming back again as a couple or even if travelling interstate on business, much more fun than your boring CBD hotel. This will 100% be our first choice for any future trips to Melbourne.

We would highly recommend Ramona and her beautiful home to anybody looking for a friendly, comfortable, relaxing stay - and if you have never stayed in Fitzroy it is an absolute must for anybody wanting to get to know the most interesting people and places in Melbourne!"

Linda's home is just gorgeous and has everything one could need for overnight accommodation and more!. The bed is superbly comfortable and the room was perfect. Everything was super clean and comfy. Buddy, Linda's dog, is an absolute delight and extremely charming.  

Linda is really close to the port, shops and freeway taking you to the airport and there was easy parking out the front. 

Linda was a fantastic host, very flexible and helped me when I wasn't feeling very well. She is a very easy person to talk with, hang out with and she made me feel so at home at her place. "

We really appreciated the attention to detail, the welcoming cozy room, the fresh bread and muffins every morning, the Nick Cave memorabilia, and other great vintage finds.  We didn't enjoy the all night party next door, but Ramona assures us that this was an extreme case and was going to have a word to the new neighbours.  We would definitely stay here again.  "
227028,16660355,2014-07-31,16116695,Fiona,93,"Dan's apartment is as beautiful as it appears in the pictures, its spacious, clean, minimal and light. I stayed 9 days and it was great to have such a well equipped kitchen so I could eat in when I wanted to. During the daytime the space is calm and relaxed and its location is fantastic for exploring Melbourne either on foot or by public transport. Dan was a great host, we didn't meet as she was away when I stayed but we had smooth email communication throughout and she was very helpful with tips of what to do, see, where to eat, shop etc. The only drawback was the noise at night - not so much 'people' noise as commercial noise. Due to its city centre location at the heart of the CBD there were regular rubbish truck collections every morning between 3.30am and 6am. I'm not keen on ear plugs so this was a bit frustrating for me but I'm sure if you can wear them you wouldn't have any problems. I stayed in the depths of winter and the apartment was also quite cold (but then it was one of the worst winter's for years so don't let this put you off, just be prepared with extra layers if you're staying at that time of year). Overall I was very happy with my stay and would highly recommend it.    "

Ramona is a wonderful source of knowledge on the local area and Melbourne as a whole - she provides you with maps, recommendations of places to eat and things to do, she's very friendly and approachable. The living room/kitchen area is really bright with floor to ceiling windows and outdoor space and the location in Fitzroy is perfect as you are located in the independent heartland of Melbourne with wonderful boutiques, cafes and restaurants right on the doorstep.

The room was on its own level, and we stayed in there and made occasional forays into the kitchen. It was very easy and comfortable to be there, no feeling of awkwardness, and Ramona contacted us by text if there was ever anyone else going to be in the house or anything unexpected. 
 We also appreciated the vegan welcome chocolate!
If we went back to Melbourne, we would definitely stay here again."

43429,36341354,2015-06-27,10857302,Fleur,97,"My husband and I had a lovely stay at the Javanese Studio for 3 nights.  Cosy accommodation with great heating and small kitchen, living area and bathroom.  Hosts were lovely and left some jam, bread, milk, cereals, juice etc for breakfast which was appreciated.  We utilised the off street car park which was handy for our car and it was also great to have an IGA a few doors down including a cafe and some take away food outlets for convenience.   Location for us was really great too as not far from the freeways.  Highly recommend this accommodation but thought it was worth mentioning that the bed, although comfortable, was quite small (double) so if you are big people like us who are used to Queen/King size bed might be a challenge! Overall we thought this accommodation was great value for money in a handy location if you need to be in the SE suburbs of Melbourne."

The house really is wonderfully located, and in one for the best parts of Melbourne to explore, a really arty and fun area with charming shops and restaurants and close to the city centre. The house itself is stunning and spacious and immaculate. We really didn't want to leave and would have been happy living there!!

Ramona herself is charming and her attention to detail is incredible, from maps of the area, to fresh bread left in the kitchen, to a Miki card provided, lovely fresh towels and an exceptionally powerful shower. She also gave us recommendations of places to go and see that were fantastic - such as 69 Gertrude Street for coffee, do check this place out! All in all i thought it was an inspiration staying here - i am an Air B and B host myself in London and will be taking back many a tip from my stay!"

Unfortunately, we realized that we had only the airbnb contact number instead of Chis' telephone number. We asked a neighbour who directed us to his nephew's house around the corner and his girlfriend called Chris. Although Chris was out at dinner we were able to use the key safe to gain entry into chris' house.  
After gettng to know Chris next morning we realized that we unfortunately put our landline number at airbnb. Therefore, Chris could not get in contact with us the week before we arrived.
Chris gave us good tips of what to see and how to get around. The location of his house between St. Kilda and CBD next to Albert Park is perfect. For breakfast Chris went to local bakeries in order to offer us  good food! 
On our last night (Christmas Eve) Chris took us to Smith Street and we had dinner together at Huxtable, what we really enjoyed!
Chris was a very good host and we enjoyed our stay in Melbourne a lot. Chris, thank you for the gift you gave us at our departure.  "

The house was perfect and in such a great location - there is so much going on in Fitzroy. Everything is walkable from there too- it's about 30 minutes to the CBD and an hour across lovely parks to reach Church Rd and the suburbs south of the river.

Ramona made the stay so much better by being thoughtful and going that extra mile - those things you wouldn't get in a hostel or hotel like maps of the area, restaurant and cafe recommendations, bike helmets for the city bikes, and umbrellas, and being able to help yourself to tea and coffee! 

I would definitely stay at Gorgeous George when next returning to Melbourne. "

Monash University is a 13 minute walk from Vicki's house - a perfect location for any students or medical /health staff going to uni or the Frankston hospital. 
Vicki was the most gracious host. She is always smiling and goes out of her way to make you comfortable and help you out. 
Not only did I save money by staying here (rather than a motel), but I was so much more comfortable here as I had access to a full kitchen, my own room, much more space and an absolutely beautiful host.

The cottage is very cosy and private. It's just as described and as shown in the photos. It was lovely staying in bed and looking out onto the property. It's very close to the main part of Healesville, but when you're in the cottage it feels secluded enough to be a bush escape. It was great value for money. 


there and it was excellent value for money. I apologise for being too slow - I didnt realise there was a time limit on reviews!
I would certainly recommend to others going to Yarra Valley

Of the 5 or so high quality BnB residences I have stayed at, Ryan and Rhiannon offer the best by far.
Quite a lot of gratis, e.g. coffee, tea, bikes, in room TV. 
Transport just a short 3 minute walk.
Quality spacious home. The home is far better than advertised.

1) The bed an their sheets, there were so spongy that I barely could get up from it.
2) The crockery was beautiful, in impeccable condition and some bowls with lovely Chinese details
3) The tuppers, of all shapes and sizes, super useful to store any remains of cooked food for the following day.
4) he living room was homelike, perfect to have an entertaining chat during dinner or to work/study on the day.
5) The shower warmth and pressure is exactly what anyone needs to start/finish the day.
6) But nothing would be that good without the person who leaves her own seal in that beautiful place.

We were looking for a baby friendly apartment with a good location in Melbourne, close to the public transport. Because we had lots of questions about the apartment, location and Airbnb we sent more than 30 emails. The response that we got from Danielle and Ruth was great, always a fast and friendly response, even after all the emails we send. First week we stayed at the Brunswick apartment and the second week in the apartment in Carlton. Both were very fresh, clean and cosy and had all the things we needed for our stay in Melbourne. They provided a baby cot, high chair and even a basket with toys for our daughter to play with. The location of the Carlton apartment is really perfect, close the public transport and Lygon Street where there are many shops and restaurants, Brunettis was our favourite. Thanks again for making our stay in Melbourne truly perfect."

It's a perfect cosy/sexy place for a romantic getaway to Melbourne. Plus it's got a really good view of South Yarra. The building is in a great neighborhood with an excellent breakfast/coffee spot on the ground floor, as well as a famous (and delicious!) patisserie just next door. There are plenty of restaurants and cafes within walking distance, as well as a train station a couple blocks away. Oh, and, the other important bits: The bed is crazy-comfortable and the shower is brilliant. Thanks for everything, Mia! We hope we'll be able to come back sometime and stay again.

Peaceful surroundings looking out onto charming gardens, yet still an easy drive to Healesville.  The cottage felt spacious & had all we needed.  A delicious breakfast was provided.  Our only regret was the fact that it was way too cold to sit on the deck with a glass of wine in hand."

150729,11070141,2014-03-19,118979,Gaetano,97,"Ramona Audrey is probably the best host, after over 50 rentals(mostly in Europe and NYC) I have ever had!!  She is gracious and willing to help with any information the guest needs.  She provides detailed arrival instructions (even a preferred, more convenient airport shuttle (Starbus v. Skybus) to her flat) and agreeable house rules, so there are no surprises for either party.  The flat is modern, spotless, and efficient, and use of kitchen is permitted. She provides wonderful artisan breads, teas and juices for breakfast.  The decorations, from the 1920-30s are arranged in an artful mode, make the flat most hospitable and relaxing.  Her area of Fitzroy is also of that era and gentrified, with many restaurants, shops and pubs, with convenient tram service to all ares of Melbourne.  Audrey provided updated information during my 9 night stay of other guests' arrivals/departures, and they were all well mannered.

I have been to Melbourne 4 times for the Australian F1 race (a great event) and I am hopeful when I return in 2015 Audrey will again accept me as a guest.  I have complete confidence in her abilities and recognize the care with which she maintains her flat, even more so  that I do not have to search for an alternative.  Audrey is a great example of what a good host should be."

She gave great advice to help us find interesting places to visit, delicious food, easy and cheap transport and was just an all round lovely lady to stay with. The house is beautiful, (exactly as described) roomy but cosy and comfortable. As it is so close to everything, we could walk, catch a tram and pop in whenever we felt tired, yet it was beautifully peaceful down the little alleyway it's in with just enough light in the morning for early birds or sleepy heads. It's a shame we couldn't give her more stars because we both were so grateful for the company and guidance during our first big trip alone. A special thank you to the lovely Roger who treated us everyday with his adorable and gentle nature and the amazing collection of books and dvd's. Thank you so much Sharyn and we hope to stay with you again in the future! "

Talk about above and beyond - Gloria even collected us from the train station!

Thanks Gloria.  We loved your funky home.  Thanks for allowing us to stay. We hope to see again on another trip."

Her home, while an older unit, is spotlessly clean on arrival, a state which is continually maintained during the stay. While the unit is not large it is very comfortable and all kitchen and laundry facilities are available, along with tv/radio/internet. 
Located in the inner eastern suburb of Kew, it has good public transport close at hand providing quick and direct access to the Melbourne CBD,  with all regular shopping requirements again readily available within 200 metres of the property on the High St. 
The block in which the unit is located is well secured, as is the unit. Kate and her property offer guests excellent value for money and is highly recommended.

We basically liked everything from the assortment of organic sour dough bread, to the jams, to the chemical free liquid soap in the bathroom and laundry.  The location is great just off funky Gertrude St and Brunswick St and we loved exploring the organic bakery, Health food shops, wine bars and cafe's and art galleries.   It's just a short walk to No 86 tram which takes you into the city or up Smith St.  Ramona is bright and friendly, always ready with helpful advice if needed, but also respectful of privacy at the same time.  We will definitely stay there  on our next visit to  Melbourne. "

Alan  was a wonderful host and I really enjoyed our long chats over a pot (or two) of tea and home made bread. The bed, room and facilities were all very comfortable and clean - it is a really beautifully kept old cottage. I was in walking distance of most places I needed to get to - though I often jumped on a passing tram just because I could. I especially loved the 10 minute walk in the early morning to the local swimming pool through the local tree-lined streets. Both Jack and Amy were wonderful company and I look forward to having the opportunity to stay again."

My partner and I loved staying there! The room was well proportioned, and the queen bed was very comfortable. The heating was also excellent - and a welcome relief from the Melbourne cold.
This was my first AirBnB experience. Ramona has set the bar very high for other hosts! She gave us some excellent recommendations for local eateries and art galleries which we visited during our stay. For vegans or vegetarians, Ramona also has a great knowledge of local ethical restaurants, which was appreciated. She was also always contactable, professional, and organised throughout the process.
We loved the house, room, and suburb (Fitzroy) and will definitely be back on our next trip to Melbourne. Highly recommended :)

The three level accomodation is perfect - I stayed upstairs on a level all to myself and with a private bathroom.  Location wise couldn't be better.  Moments to excellent inner city cafes and shops - staying here locates you in the heart of inner city funkdom.  The nearby tram will have you into the city in 10 minutes.

The host Allan Gibb welcomed us warmly and was always around when needed, but was very discreet at all times.
The accommodation was very comfortable and big enough to house two persons with ease, a comfortable double bed , and a kitchen good enough for mny meals to be savoured, we had full use of the outer verandah, for barbeques.
and of course the herb garden!! we had thyme, mint, lemons, garlic and green onions..
Overall 
Very good for long stays and short stays , very safe environment, good for walking in the mornings and evenings, has a convenience store a few steps down the road and a hairdresser.
a bus a walk down the road takes you to chdstone shopping centre and oakleigh.

Mal and Nok's place at Hadfield is cosy, clean and has all the amenities you could need and more. There are shops and a playground just around the corner, and if you prefer to take public transport to the city, you can walk to the train station. Otherwise, the bus just around the corner from Mal and Nok's place will take you to the train station in no time.

Mal and Nok are friendly, approachable and helpful with advice ranging from food to transport. They are also generous and present our girls with strawberries and juices.

We absolutely loved it. It's a huge space packed full of original warehouse features.
The  big half round windows look out to a North East aspect which allows light to flood in during the day. 
Whilst it's very open, it also feel private and it's easy to forget you are right in the heart of Melbourne.
Make sure you read and follow Michelle's tips to bars, cafes and restaurants as we tried most of them over 2-3 days and they were a perfect match to our taste.
One not on the list, but should be, is Brother Baba Budan coffee shop literlly 15 metres outside the front door. They say it's one of the best coffee shops in Melbourne, and we wouldn't disagree.
Michelle's communication was effortless, and we'd certainly return."

I enjoyed staying at Mario's place since he is a kind & warm person and his recommendation to use Go West tour was wonderful as well, I really enjoyed my one day trip to Great Ocean Road back then.
Mario's apartment is strategically located in the heart of the city with just a walk away to nearest tram station & downtown Melbourne, thus his place was perfect for 5 star accommodation with 5 star facilities title. "

Aircon worked very well on the 43 degree days too. Public transport is close, the 96 tram will get you into the city in maybe 20 minutes, or down to Fitzroy in 10, plus High Street Northcote with bars, caf√©s, shops, and supermarkets is only 10-15 mins walk away. My folks were all pleased with the accommodation and everything went smoothly for me arranging it too. All in all, a well-priced accommodation option I'd have no problem recommending.

Being mid-way between trams 11 and 86, it was easy getting into the city centre - about half an hour.

Unfortunately, I couldn‚Äôt stay there for two months as I have planned because of the noise and I am not a special case of noise sensitivity (I used earplugs all the time)!!! I had to left this place because of the noise. It is just at a really busy intersection and the old house has no insulation at all. The street goes literally through the house. Also, he bribed me to not say anything in this review about the noise and in return he would have given me a refund of one week. Poor behavior!!!! As I am an honest type, I rather want to tell the truth about Lindsay and his place for future guests. I would have appreciated the same. The apartment doesn‚Äôt look like as the pictures say. It is dirty, dusty (especially in the kitchen) and full of mould (especially in the bathroom on the shower curtain). Apart from all that it is cheap and for a couple of days maybe a good option."

Linda has been the most amazing host and her home is just perfect for those looking for somewhere to relax and/or fully enjoy all that Melbourne has to offer.

Words cannot describe how beautiful Linda‚Äôs home is. The d√©cor and layout could be straight out of style magazine and Linda makes sure you have everything you need and more and is always at hand to help and advise you on what‚Äôs hot and what‚Äôs not in Melbourne.

I cannot recommend Linda and her home enough, she has made me feel at home and I feel privileged to have met Linda and her lovely circle of friends, who are a complete hoot‚Ä¶ (Lynne, Heather, Alan to name a few‚Ä¶ oh and even Errol :P and of course I mustn't forget Boof the adorable 10 month old puppy, who is just so loving and well behaved.

This was a great experience with interesting things to do for all ages. The small group allowed for good interaction and customization. I'd definitely do this experience again."

The hospitality of the hosts was wonderful and they were most helpful in finding my way in a new place. They provided me with a breakfast each day to getting me going on my way.  The location was great as it was a short walk to eat places for the evening meals and a service station local for filling up before the next part of my journey.

Me and my girlfriend had to clean the bathroom and the bedroom, as they were filthy with dust, spiders and little bugs If he messes with his food and his clothes without permission, do not worry about him being normal. According to himself the room was not cleaned a year ago.
The house is very closed, so it is important to open some windows to circulate the air and leave the odors.

If you do not have any problems with this, move on. I closed 4 months and I was only 1. 

Good luck."

Linda‚Äôs flat has a lot of air and a well equipped kitchen with an outdoor place for eating or just relaxing. The room I used was just what I needed, equipped with a bed that easily could accommodate two and a private bathroom nearby. It was all kept clean and tidy in a kind of casual way. Linda herself was very easygoing, easy to chat with without being socially demanding. So to conclude, my five days at her place was very enjoyable and I can recommend it to anyone with similar preferences."

All was absolutely perfect from start to finish.
Ramona is the host you want to have, at your disposal for a chat or inquiries yet subtle enough to leave you with all the room you need to enjoy her wonderful house. All is taken care of the minute you walk through the gate.
Going somewhere else in Melbourne wouldn't make any sense.

First of all Mario's apartment is in an excellent location in the heart if the Melbourne CBD and very close to public transport which made exploring Melbourne that much easier. Secondly it was like staying in a five star hotel if not better... the place is very clean and tidy and Mario has thought of everything right down to sunscreen and an umbrella.

There is also the Merri Creek nearby if you want to be in nature for a bit.  The house and room are exactly as described. It can get a bit cool but there is a heater in the bedroom. The bedroom was freshly cleaned. In the rest of the house there was a bit of dust and crumbs but it doesn't smell bad or anything like that.

What a wonderful pair
You would be pretty silly 
Not to stay there
They are both very pretty
They are both very kind
They are both very clever
With big hearts that shine
Your bed will be lovely
It will swallow you up
You can even drink tea
From a holding hand cup!
They don't even mind
If you hang out together
They help you catch trams
And warn of bad weather
They both have their stories
To tell & to share
They're listeners too
And they actually care!
Staying in Richmond
What a nice treat
So many great shops
And places to eat
I feel pretty lucky
I have to admit
To have met these two beauties
On my Melbourne trip
I'll be coming back soon
I hope the room's free (unoccupied...duh)
I can't wait to see them again
Over a Moroccan tea :)"

He picked us up from the air port, printed out maps and timetables for bus/train, made breakfast, had answers for all of our questions(like good food places) and the list just goes on. The house is also great, you have your own little private part and you can go into the living room if you want to socialise. So if you want to stay in a lovely home with great people then I'd recommend staying with Ryan any day."

On top of this, Mario is a superb host, easy going, friendly, and engaging and helpful when planning trips etc. Makes you feel very much at home and at ease...

Fine room, good bed, even a small fridge and you can make use of their kitchen which is more a kitchen for a huge restaurant.  After a ten minutes walk you are in a train taking you downtown and on the other site it's close to the airport as well.
Karen and her husband Jim are warm persons and great to be with although we didn't spent much time together.

74548,15970955,2014-07-19,17209137,Harry,90,"Mario is very warm and cool person (a bit of paradox there). He was kind enough to show me the famous Queen Victoria Market and even bought me a B√∂rek! Cheers for that mate! You get to do the things you want to do in the aparment, even washing your clothes and Mario always gives you  privacy. However he's also eager to have a conversation and a quiet movie night now and then. He also lets you his kitchen utensils, even some of his ingredients.

Since it is my first time coming to Melbourne, I was slightly surprised almost everybody knows about the Milano Towers. You got your own sleek, cozy room with lots of light in the day and darkness at night, guaranteeing deep and restful sleep. Not to mention your own bathroom with fresh towels. The kitchen area and living room is to die for, oh and the sofa, don't be sitting there if you want to explore Melbourne I tell you.
You also get access to the Gym and Pool area, it is just beautiful the things you can do there. Half or third the price of a hotel room and you get a kitchen, Wi-Fi, Gym, Pool.

The location is 5 minutes or less away from Melbourne central/ Melbourne central station, QV, Queen Victoria Market. Basically the heart of the city is right in front of you. Aldi is right downstairs as well!

The best place to stay if you're want to be close to the heart of the city!

Cheers,
Harry"

The loft was everything we hoped for and more (the swing is such a fun bonus!)

I would definitely recommend Michelle's loft to anyone interested in experiencing Melbourne at it's best!"
51592,3457284,2013-02-02,1666576,Heather,0,"My cousin and I spent 10 great nights here as part of our 50th birthday celebrations and a visit to the tennis.  The key features for us were;
1.  The location.  We walked from the Skybus terminal at Southern Cross Station (with more luggage you could catch the free shuttle up to the Adina Apartments very near on Queen St)...and kept walking all week!  You step out of the flat into the centre of Melbourne with bars, restaurants, shops and transport at the door or within a block.  No trouble for us to walk to Southbank or even the tennis, MCG, NGV, Botanic Gardens etc.  And there's Hardware Lane around the corner for that nightcap on the way home.  We went on tours to Phillip Island and Great Ocean Rd  and declined local pick up as it was just as easy to stroll down to Federation Square.  The only tram we caught was to St Kilda....and the free circular tram just for fun.  Before I left, I had been mildly anxious about returning home late, if ever alone, to the laneway... but the entrance is only a few metres in from Little Bourke St and there were always lots of people about.  
2.  The vibe.  It really is just like it is in the pictures.  Those fabulous windows and the beautiful light.  And the SPACE.  We had a little soiree with friends and it was a great entertaining space.  We often lingered in the morning enjoying the sunshine... and stayed in a couple of nights, once during a beautiful thunderstorm.  We might have got cabin fever in a hotel room but staying in felt like part of the holiday.  I even cooked a few times. We did not need the air con even on the 35 degree day - the direct sun is gone by lunch time. 
3.  Michelle made me up a bed on a mattress on the floor under the mezzanine that was perfectly comfy for a short stay.  A lot of other places we considered meant that we would have had to share a bed or have one of us on the sofabed in the living room...but this worked well. 
4.  There are a lot of guidebooks and local info in the flat.  This is Michelle's specialist subject/business. 
5.  Michelle was prompt, communicative and flexible with our dates and check in/out times.  

Things to consider;
Think twice if you are a sensitive/light sleeper.  This place is light and in the centre of a busy, vibrant city.  Revellers, garbage trucks and light industry are around you.  We rather liked that ...but I know some who would struggle. The place is designed for a single or a couple -  the shower/hot tub area has no door and leads off the kitchen. The TV is relatively small so your man may have to talk to you or enjoy Melbourne instead!

The location and the place are fun and quirky.  We loved it and had a fabulous time in marvellous Melbourne. "
257149,12824934,2014-05-12,12423085,Heather,84,"Our trip in Melbourne was made all the more better by staying in Lanie's homely and cosy flat. Lanie was so accommodating with all our needs and she's a really friendly, lovely person! If you're seeking a funky little pad near some great shops on high street, and an easy 20minute train ride into Central Melbourne, this is the place for you! Thanks for everything Lanie, we loved staying there! : )"
74715,25416678,2015-01-15,13613126,Hedley,96,"Walter and Amanda were great hosts, very relaxed and kindly let me share the evening meal on my first night with them.  Walter and Amanda both were happy to share the kitchen, fridge and dining facilities and  I felt very at home in their family home - I felt like I'd lived there ages after 8 nights of being there!

Great location for Dennis station (a 10 min brisk walk), and not far from Fairfield either (bit further), Dennis being only 13 mins from Flinders Street if you get the right train in the mornings, but the longest is only about 18 mins I think!

I was in Melbourne searching for a place to live and a job, so it was very handy getting to the CBD, and I could change trains in the CBD for other lines if I needed them.  Also the house is just off the 508 (East/West) bus route (Separation Street) which traverses the train/tram lines and takes you across Northcote and Brunswick to Moonee Ponds which is very useful and ran perfectly on time when I was travelling (school holidays).  Walter gave me a lift to Fairfield Boat House - a lovely spot on the river.

Also very relaxed about arrival and departure time - no fixed times were stipulated, which was really appreciated.  Also they gave me lots of advice about different suburbs and local shops and transport options, which was most helpful.  And good wifi connection was very handy too!  And thanks for the loan of the umbrella and the highlighters!

The room is at the back of the house which gives you some privacy/quiet if needed from the main rooms in the house, and also it was nice to sit in the yard of an evening with a drink after a hard day pounding the streets.

All in all, a great stay :-)"

Cosy, comfortable, clean and peaceful little cabin in a lovely setting, Karen welcomed us on our arrival, supplied fresh bread, milk and everything we could need for a continental breakfast, as well as a thermos and picnic equipment for our daily jaunts.    It was lovely to wake up to the sound of the kookaburras and enjoy watching the passing parade of kangaroos as we breakfasted on the verandah.

As this was my first AirBNB experience, I was concerned I'd feel awkward about using the bathroom and kitchen facilities but that certainly wasn't the case. Kate's manner was friendly and welcoming from the moment I knocked on the door. With regard to convenience, Kate's apartment is a very easy walk to the tram that takes you into the city. There are beautiful riverside walks nearby and numerous restaurants and cafes very close at hand. There are also several supermarkets within walking distance. I'd highly recommend Kew Tranquility. Thank you, Kate."
111001,134904400,2017-03-01,5099832,Helen,100,"Only so-so. Rooms small, furniture really cheap and flimsy. Kitchen hours inconvenient. We were refused fresh towels on our 3rd day."

She was very accommodating to our arrival and departure times and our daily comings and goings.  An interesting warehouse conversion to pleasant apartment living in a  vibrant central CBD location."

244952,1749294,2012-07-19,2767272,Helen,97,This is such a quiet place even though right in the heart of things! A perfect location for cages and shops and tram lines are so close too. We loved the park and museum right around the corner. The apartment is compact but very light and airy. We loved it!
244952,44426086,2015-08-26,33270312,Helen,100,"This was our first Airbnb experience, and if all the hosts are like Rebecca it's no wonder that Airbnb is so popular!  Rebecca was prompt in replying to our booking request, and the house rules were easy to follow when we arrived. 
The weather was quite cold, and the large heater in the living room made the unit very cosy. We had a hire car, and having a designated car park off the street was great, as the area has limited parking available.
The unit is close to trams, with easy access to the city, and there are many small restaurants in Gertrude Street only 10 minutes walk away.
The unit is clean, the bed warm and comfortable, lovely hot water in the shower, and with the trees outside it's like  coming back to a cosy nest at the end of the day!"
66754,61879941,2016-02-09,46467525,Helen,100,"This was the first time I had used airbnb and was slightly apprehensive but need not have been. The description of the apartment was very accurate and perfect for the two of us.The communications from the hosts were friendly and helpful with clear , detailed ,pre-entry instructions and information about the apartment, surrounding area and transport etc. The apartment itself was clean, comfortable and well equipped.The bed was comfortable and the bathroom had a good,powerful walk in shower. The outside sitting area was small as described and although not private,perfectly adequate to enjoy a coffee in the morning or a glass of wine in the evening. The residents of the other properties were friendly and considerate.
The location of the apartment was perfect for us as we were visiting family living nearby but Richmond itself is a great area to stay. There are good train and tram links to the nearby city centre and the apartment is near many great cafes , restaurants and bars. It is easy walking distance to the major sports venues,shops and the beautiful yarra river and botanic gardens.
Although advertised as no parking ,the hosts indicated that a parking permit might be available. We did not need this but without one parking would be a problem.
We stayed for 5 weeks in the apartment and found it ideal for the 2 of us. We had a great time and I hope we will go back on our next visit."

The appartement is well furnished and offers a lot kitchen facilities. We also liked the possibility to park our car in a own covered car park. A minor disadvantage is the road next to the appartement-house, which is a bit busy at times. "

As we ate out mostly we didn't need the stove, but everything was set up well for breakfast.
The location is perfect for walking into the city and to Carlton's famous Brunetti's cakes, and to family members living nearby. And it's very quiet.
Would recommend indeed to travellers wanting to savour the delights of inner-city Melbourne.

From the moment I arrived, she made me feel like an old friend being welcomed home. The room is beautiful, spacious, and spotless, and the cushiony bed ensured a comfy sleep every night. Free use of her coffee machine and a generous spread of tea, cereal, and fruit left me feeling very pampered. Daniela was always available for advice about Melbourne or just a chat. I was truly sad to leave.¬†"

Use of the full kitchen and washing machine was great, the shower and WiFi worked well, and the building complex and neighborhood felt safe. Would definitely stay here again!"

The hot shower is an experience to remember, much better than my own place. 
The breakfast is more than I ahve got in many hotels; selection of mueslis along with fresh seasonal fruits was just a divine healthy start of the day. 
Overall Chris made an extra effort of making me comfortable during my three days of stay. He was quick with his responses, as I made my booking very late, was helpful, caring and courteous host. He even gave me Myki card and provided all the directions. 
This place is conveniently situated in beautiful Albert Park, close to Tram station and for me it was just 10min from convention centre.  This was my first experience with Airbnb and I am glad I made this decision. If I am ever again in Melbourne, I am certain I will go to Chris's place."

268849,186925697,2017-08-26,38314499,Holly,98,"In such a fantastic location! Two Birds One Stone is the perfect place for breakfast and lunch. The apartment is luxurious and comes with everything you need. The cosy bed and Sheridan linen made it feel like a an expensive hotel, the price tag was the complete opposite! In the hub of everything South Yarra has to offer it was great to have a car space included and with the train station two minutes walk away we barely even needed to use the car. Great suggestions for places to eat by the host really topped everything off. Very happy guest!"

268849,338946589,2018-10-21,105665593,Holly,100,"Thank you so much for having us at your place! We had a super wonderful stay in South Yarra. The apartments location is incredibly convenient (easy/short walking distance) to the train station, to a supermarket and convenience stores. Having coffee pods and a small container of milk was such a welcomed added touch and funnily really made my day each morning. Netflix on the TV, and the wifi was also really fantastic. The apartment was very clean, modern and comfortable with the convenience of a washer and dryer. My only suggestion would be to beware that whilst there is an air-conditioning system in the lounge, there is otherwise no air conditioning or fans in the bedroom which can get a little warm through the night. Hosts were very kind and always communicated clearly and promptly. Thanks again for having us at your place!"

We got lots of gorgeous sunlight with this top level apartment. Since the bedroom and the bathroom were the only things on this floor, we got a lot of space and privacy.

To top it off, Ramona bribed my girlfriend with lots of muffins and tea which she would nibble on contently through the day.

In addition, the home decoration are an inspiration. I'd marvel at how Ramona came up with these ideas and I confess that I might have walked away with an idea or two.

Ramona herself was a fantastic host! She was helpful and perpetually cheerful. I had the best time here!"

Her house is stylish and welcoming, full of little touches that make it a joy to return home after a sojourns wandering the vibrant Melbourne streets.
I don't normally stay in shared accommodation. Usually I worry that the host could be overbearing or I'll feel like I'm treading on their toes.
Not at Ramona's. If you fell like keeping to yourself, the only interaction you need is to sing-out to let her know you are coming or going. 
She provides you with all the info you need to make the most of your time in the form of an array of guides and maps. She also really knows her town and pointed me straight to the perfect eateries and areas of interest. every tip was spot on. 
The house is in the perfect location and was just as it was described. The local area is perfect for anyone wanting to immerse themselves in Melbourne's rich urban culture and only a short walk to many of the cities other attractions. It's also really easy to get to/from if you are driving  (which I was- Ramona even kindly let me use the parking permit!).

I could go on and on about how amazing the place is and how lovely Ramona is but basically: 
Stay there! you won't be disappointed.
I'll definitely be back, if she'll have me!

She helps me a lot with the event on her amazing loft, Michelle prepared the food and drinks, also borrowed a projector for us watching World Cup games. The loft located really central Melbourne, easy to get any transportation you want. The loft is big, nice decoration, and really fit for a small gathering or event. I will definitely book this place again next time if it's a event. Though there only has one bed in the loft when most people want to stay over night if they have a party or something last quite long."

You affect a lot for the reason of being in your house with remarkably comfortable mind. I don't know if I could be here again, but I want to be here to see you guys again. I won't forget what you've done for me as well as what you've shared to me. And I forgot how to spell the Korean word I wrote in the farewell card, it is pronounced 'sarang'. Hope you guys like it. Seriously I AM miss you!!!!!!! Right now and ever!!!! See you very soon
P.S. I will never forget the DJ Moment!:)"

I stayed for a week on the top floor suite and everything was impeccable from cleanliness, organic products in the bathroom to fluffly towels.

I didn't see the host too often only due to differing time tables but felt very welcome all the same. The neighbourhood is lively and packed with shops, galleries and restaurants, with multiple tram lines running frequently to the city and beyond- a great location for first time tourists and those re visiting Melbourne.
Thank you Ramona! "
150729,72875582,2016-05-05,24671633,Isabelle,94,"The most perfect Airbnb host I've ever stayed with- Ramona honestly has no flaws as a host. She was always contactable from the moment I booked with her and extremely helpful with every question or query about my trip. Her house is more like a gallery which makes everyday a joy to wake up too. She has decorated the place so considerately and stylishly and I found something new to discover everyday! I've never slept so well in my whole life, one night I even fell asleep at 7pm because the beds were just so amazingly comfortable and I feel I can judge this well as I stayed in two of her rooms and both were equally fabulous. Ramona is the most wonderful part of the stay because she not only is unbelievably kind, but has a most brilliant personality and was just great to be around. She welcomes conversation if you'd like but equally gives you space if that's what you prefer. She completely welcomed and opened her home to me and I felt totally at home throughout the duration of my stay.Thank you Ramona for a most perfect stay in Melbourne. I would return in a second. "

In the bedroom upstairs, you could easily believe you are in a countryside retreat. The studio is really homey, and Lulu makes sure that your stay is super easy, leaving public transport cards, fruits, a bottle of wine...
Best Airbnb I have ever stayed in so far. We will be back!"

She really is the most excellent host and I couldn't have had a better stay! "

I do not have enough words to thank or appreciate their efforts in making our stay with them memorable. They have made a permanent place in our hearts. Soon enough the excellent facilities available at the property were secondary to the hospitality and warmth shown by the Hargreaves family including their 3 lovely daughters. For people like me who are new to Melbourne, there can never be a better picture of a perfect Australian family..Jesus be with them always and thumbs up to their property..we will miss the fun we had here.....Just dont have to worry about anything @ Daryls' place!!!!!....well located in a beautiful surrounding and close to everything...you are in an upmarket country side lifestyle with everything chic and modern around.............cheers.

The location might look shady but I've always felt safe walking down the alley. Brunswick Street which is 10 mins away is lively with lots of eatery. A 15 mins walk will bring you to the free tram zone (stop 11) and saves you lots of money when entering the CBD area. Factory outlets in nearby Collingwood will save you even more money :)

The train station is a short walk away and so is the St Kilda Botanic Garden and many other things to be found in the Elwood area.

It was a leisurely stroll through Fitzroy Gardens to the city where my conference was and a lovely space to retreat to after a long day. The location is nestled away in the heart of Fitzroy so you really feel like you are in a neighbourhood but only a street away from where everything is too. 

As a host, Ramona is perfect. She has thought of everything and any questions are answered asap. 

I look forward to coming back soon. Sam"

The apartment was really well set up with everything we needed, including a portacot & high chair for our toddler, and Hoang was great to deal with. While you can hear the people upstairs, they kept similar hours to us so it didn't really bother us. "

Room was very comfortable. Getting to know Mario was also a pleasure and he was nice enough to bring my anti-social bum out for drinks and to the nearby market to meet his friends. If you're lucky he might even share his super luxurious face cream with you, which may or may not be a little awkward, but all you have to do is smile and follow his instructions and you will be fine. Mario was also a caring host and made efforts to check up on my well-being whenever possible. Truly a memorable stay, this one. "

A few limes from her garden and local travel tips were placed strategically on her dining table for my benefit. Thank you Bridget. A delightful stay."
310594,64397266,2016-03-03,49756939,James,100,"Bridget's place is a very clever use of a small space. It's effectively a one room studio above a an artisan's workshop that would once have been a garage.

Beautifully decorated, it has most of the things you will need for your stay, and is obviously used by Bridget on a regular basis, so it has a homey feel of being complete.

The bed is in a loft at the top of another flight of stairs and is open onto the living space. Since there is nowhere to put clothes, or personal items (other than a very small bookshelf not quite next to the bed) you'll need to work out how to make the novelty of this arrangement work for you. As I was staying only a couple of nights, I ended up leaving my bag on the dining table, since the bathroom and shower is just off to the side of the kitchen. Anyone who needs to get up during the night might find a trip to the bathroom a little impractical.

All in all, Bridget's place is lovely, and I enjoyed my stay there, but it is probably not practical for everyone."

Paste this for me please.

I would highly recommend Ramona as a host after my most enjoyable stay in a private room with my own bathroom in her stunning home in the Fitzroy. My room was well appointed, immaculate and tastefully furnished. Little George Street is very conveniently located and Ramona an excellent and organised host. Everything went according to plan and I was able to just simply enjoy a fabulous weekend with my son who also lives in Fitzroy.

They even invited me to join them as they gathered around the television in the evening to watch the Australian Open.  They are true sports fans and it was so much fun to be able to share that experience with them!

They have an incredibly beautiful home and the accommodations they had set up for me were perfect.  Their home is located in a nice quiet tree-lined neighbourhood that is just a short 10-minute walk to the train station.  Catch the train there and in just 15 minutes you'll be at Flinders St Station and the CBD; the heart of Melbourne.  A nice variety of eclectic restaurants and wine bars are also right up the road from their home should you choose to dine out in the local area.       

I woke each morning to a continental breakfast where I had my choice of cereal, toast, fruit, juice, etc.  Everything was set up and ready for me each morning and they were right there to help should I want or need anything else.  They also have a terrific espresso machine and will whip you up a fantastic cup of coffee to start off your day.  

I've stayed a numerous fine B&Bs around the world and their home rates right up at the top of the list.  They are a fun, engaging, and beautiful family and it was truly a privilege to get to know them as they welcomed me into their home and into their life.

I have stayed in other places three times the price and try were no way near as good as this. The location was a huge plus - located 30 seconds from the Jewell Street rail station taking me 15 minutes or less to the city centre. On Brunswick street only a minute away I found so many healthy and cost effective restaurants, it was hard to choose. There is a Kmart and Woolworths nearby which gave me the option to buy some bare essentials. The clothing shopping ranges from low to high budget, I was able to find so many unique items I wouldn't find elsewhere. 

The host Chloe was faultless. I felt welcomes from the first moment I walked in, and that didn't change over the whole week I stayed. So many fun conversations were had.... She's very funny and highly knowledgeable. I felt so relaxed I almost felt I was actually living there. I was lost a few times in Melbourne and she knew everything so well.

The bed was extremely comfortable and clean, and there was even a small walk in cupboard for me to store my clothing neatly and conveniently. The bathroom and kitchen were both spotless and everything was easy to find.

I don't usually write reviews but this experience was out of the ordinary. If you're looking around this part of the city... This place is by far and away the best value for money as well as having the friendliest host I've met!

Both were very nice hosts and made my stay feel comfortable and welcoming starting right from the beginning when I was offered a well needed cup of tea! :). The room was clean and well equipped, air con, tv, comfortable double bed, huge wardrobe. I even had full use of the iron which helped greatly with all those shirts I had to do! Breakfast was included which was delicious and everything you could need.  Thoroughly recommended"
80986,189155839,2017-09-01,4132826,Jamie,99,"I stayed at Frank and Vince's apartment while my own place was forced to undergo emergency renovations. Communication with them was brilliant and they helped not only with extending my stay when the renos took longer Jan expected - but also found me another place to stay when there's was booked. 

The location is excellent, and Richmond is a great suburb. Close to shops, caf√©s and the CBD - the place was clean, comfortable and had everything I needed. Would definitely recommend this to anyone looking to stay in Melbourne."
268849,22396147,2014-11-05,19367652,Jamie,94,"Mia's apartment is gorgeous and sexy, perfect for a weekend getaway in Melbourne. South Yarra has several great restaurants and bars - and is a short can ride from the city. I can't recommend it enough!"
268849,876522,2012-01-22,530903,Jamie,93,"Mia's apartment was an amazing place to stay. Perfectly located to wander around Chapel Street and so close to the city as well. Everything in her apartment is thoughtfully put together to create an wonderful place to stay in. The only thing more fabulous than the apartment itself was Mia's hospitality! She really did anything to make our stay special :) We'd definitely stay with Mia again, she really made our holiday perfect."
150729,25500292,2015-01-18,14381875,Jamie,97,My 20 year old daughter stayed at Ramona's and she provided lots of helpful information related to her interests and her place was very well located in a vibrant neighborhood. I appreciated Ramona's clear communication before the trip and even during the trip. 
150729,22956409,2014-11-18,16023197,Jamie,98,"Ramona is a fantastic host to the most beautiful home anyone has the privilege of staying at in inner city Melbourne. 

From the vegan chocolate she left on our bed when we arrived, to the fresh bathrobes, to the organic gluten free bread, to the fresh pillow slips that she so thoughtfully left in our room when we had a swap of friends during my stay. Not to mention, she is very accommodating to allow for that during my short 2 night stay. 

The location of the place is spot on for anyone who wants a good taste of Fitzroy (literally, with all the food and shopping options!). A very safe and convenient spot no less. I love the place so much I have decided never to go on a retreat again as Little George Street is a retreat in itself for a busy buzzing Brisbanite like me. 

This Little George Street abode deserves a 15 out of 10. Yep, that is how good it is. I cannot wait to be back! 

Perfect for anyone who values space, privacy, relaxation, vintage style, art and organic living."

The checkin process was the easiest I've had on airbnb and Ramona was really helpful with any little things I needed. She was keen for the chat but also respectful of privacy when I needed to work. If you can get a few nights here I'd recommend it. "

The yummy boutique breads that are in the fridge are sooo great and go beautifully with the gorgeous organic teas and coffee that she has on the bench for guests. 
Highly recommend!!"

She was a delightful host and her bed was great!  I loved the personal touch of 3 different types of pillows ... soft, medium, hard.  It is the little things like that, that count. 
The location was fabulous and the view was super!  The neatest part was that due to the double glass panes there was NO noise from the traffic!!!!  Amazing and truly a place of peace and quiet is what we needed after those long days at Mind Body Soul TS!  
Thank you Judy for being you and being such a great hostess :)  We will be back!"

He made my visit to Melbourne to attend an engagement party in Fitzroy not only enjoyable but so much easier by meeting me at the shuttle drop-off, escorting me safely to the venue, and driving me to the station next day. Alan makes a perfect cup of tea, bakes delicious bread, and keeps his guest-room clean and comfortable. His dog Jack and cat Amy are loveable beyond words."

His place is historic, classy and comfortable, and filled with art and antiques, and in a great location 5 min walk from Brunswick St. Alan welcomed me with home made lemon tart and a pot of tea at 9.30pm and was so accomodating in the morning when I got up late. He had freshly made bread, cold meats and cheese and fruit for breakfast.
Outstanding value in every way.

Although Ramona was away she made contact numerous times to ensure everything was going well and that they had everything they needed. The room was very comfortable and Ramona provides everything you might need during your stay. The myki cards were an added bonus as you don't need to purchase your own whilst in Melbourne.

She has really wonderful taste and has thought of everything - from the games and books I loved as a child available for playing/reading to thoughtful bakery treats available if you have time for a proper breakfast!

The room was beautifully decorated and the bed s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) comfy.  When I met Ramona it reminded me what I love about AirBNB, as she welcomed me with a big smile, and knowing I was jet lagged offered to share the couch, her TV and some wonderful japanese take-away with me... it felt like a home away from home with a great house mate to share it with (particularly wonderful as a solo traveller).  The baked goodies were also a real treat from the bakery where she works.  I loved also getting to explore Fitzroy as if I was a local.  The area is full of great eateries and amazing little shops full of all sorts of enticing things.  I absolutely loved everything about it.  Thank you so much Ramona, I suspect you may just see me again!!!"

Great location with train at one end of the street and tram at the other, and walking distance to great cafes, restaurants and shops.

They had already informed me that they would not be in till late and most likely we would not meet till the morning. It was a surreal experience to walk into someone's home without them being there. But immediately their lovely place in the world felt warm and inviting. Lovely room, bed was fabulous and one of the best nights sleep for a while. 
They did come home before I headed off to bed and it was very nice to meet them. Great hosts, and I immediately felt comfortable.

I ended up being in Melbourne for a family funeral and again the hosts were lovely and very personable.

It made such a lovely change from the sterile environments you find in hotels these days. This was Loren and Ruth's home and you felt like a friend visiting. Not just a credit card.

Definitely top of my list next time I need to stay in Melbourne.."

Walter and Amanda were absolute delights :) From the moment I walked through their door jet lagged as all get out, Walter offered me a cup of tea and he and his partner sat down and gave me the scoop on the beautiful place they call home. These hosts are warm and personable and they share a lovely home which is situated just a train ride from Oz. You are walking distance to high street which has restaurants, shopping and pubs and there's even a bike if you wish to ride into town. Amanda and Walter are very caring individuals, although I came right when she was on her way off to Europe Walter's daughter Caitlin was very warm, and I made best friends with their sweetheart of a dog Sugar :) Walter and Amanda were super welcoming and I would highly recommend staying with them if you are visiting Melbourne. This was my first Air bnb experience and I am extremely happy that I was able to share it with them :)

Cheers and thanks again for a wonderful trip :)"

She provided towels, toiletries, sun tan lotion, after sun lotion, shampoo, conditioner and shower gel and other toiletry items. We thoroughly enjoyed our stay with Judy. She was very helpful in advising where to eat, what to do and how to get around.
The location of the apartment was very good, ver close to tram stops.
The apartment more than met our expectations. It was great.

72576,4970094,2013-06-04,6358464,Jean,90,"Ramona's Little George Street offers very comfortable accommodation for the design savy & environmentally conscious. Located in the thick of Fitzroy's buzzing cafes, restaurants, bars, galleries & my absolute favourite- the vintage industrial antique stores, there is a lot to look forward to... Meeting the warm & friendly host Ramona added to my experience... Always will be my first choice to stay on future visits to Melbourne"
72576,473539840,2019-06-21,6358464,Jean,0,"Staying at Ramona's place as always is a treat, even in the chilly Melbourne Weather. This was my forth stay at Ramona's & I always look forward to staying & seeing what new collectibles she has sourced since the the last visit. Always warm & inviting & happy to share her local knowledge about where to go & whats new to eat & drink. This has become my place to stay whenever I come to Melbourne, I'm sure it will become your too"
256186,14690398,2014-06-24,14838242,Jean,100,"Thank you to Michael and Hoang for being such generous and accommodating hosts for our 10 night stay. The apartment was modern, spacious and well stocked with everything a family with a toddler, or young child could need. It was so nice to come back after a long day out to this little home away from home. Perfectly located with convenient access to stores, the CBD and major freeways, this really made our trip easier as we could get to where we wanted faster!"
72576,18418475,2014-08-26,6358464,Jean,96,"This is my 3rd visit to Ramona's place. Ramona is always smiling & happy to help out with anything, especially if it is food, well Melbourne related. I loved the comfy flannel sheets on the bed with the emergency hot water bottle, which is perfect for the freezing Melbourne winters. I love the assortment of breads & teas available each day when you dont feel like venturing out or if you are on a budget. Venturing out you'll find everything you need a short walk or tram ride away.
Simply Ramona's place is a home away from home & I'll certainly be staying there again on my next Melbourne adventure. Hopefully it will be a summer visit"
43429,59030539,2016-01-06,21240494,Jean Charles (JC),0,"We had a great time at Allan and Lizzie's place. The kitchen, the barbecue and the large covered terrace with seating for 6 to 8 allowed us to entertain our children during our stay.
The location close to the Chadstone mall is great as long as you have a car. There is a convenient IGA store and bottle shop 300 meter down the road.
Thank you both for being good hosts and making sure the apartment was in mint condition."

Mario made access so easy to his great apartment, even though he was not there, 
I really felt welcome
Easy to find ones way around either by tram or on foot, Mario supplied lots of information about Melbourne
I loved the artificial grass on the balcony, great underfoot
Mariohas outdone himself with the extras I the bathroom - much appreciated

Allan's left us with breakfast and chocolates and drinks... in the fridge so we had everything we needed. There is nothing much to stay but a fantastic place to stay. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a short or long term stay in the suburb of Melbourne. Thanks Allan for everything."

Or perhaps a coffee at one of the nearby cafes/restaurants or even a stroll up to the city. A great spot indeed.

Chris is a knowledgable, well travelled and easy going host whose impressive & broad array of breakfast supplies guarantees a perfect start to the day too.

I thoroughly enjoyed my stay here and would stay again without hesitation."

Malcolm and Tracey were very gracious hosts and the apartment was exactly what we needed.  You cannot beat the location in downtown Melbourne‚Äîit‚Äôs in a great part of the city with tons of good bars, restaurants, cafes, and shopping just right out the door.  Collins St. provides excellent access to the trams and it was dead simple to get to Southern Cross station, and from there, to and from the airport.  

The apartment itself is a very nicely appointed, clean, and spacious studio.  We thought the bed was really comfortable, the living area/television area was nice to relax in, the kitchen area was handy, the AC worked great (though we didn‚Äôt need to use it much as we lucked out with the weather), and the bathroom was very spacious.  There was also free wifi and our hosts let us use their computer too which was a nice touch.  Overall we had a really great time and we would definitely recommend this apartment to other travelers (singles or couples) who would like to spend several days in the city.

"
241263,27955875,2015-03-15,738619,Jeff,94,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at Gloria's. The location was great - a short tram to the city + it was close to Brunswick where our friends were staying.

First timer to AIRBNB & was so impressed at the ease of the entire experience - from reading reviews, confirming to arrival, was so seamless.  Unfort I didn't meet Mario who was away all weekend, but met his gf Haylee who kindly greeted me on arrival.  Place was faultless, room was exactly what I needed, comfy comfy bed & your own ensuite & surprisingly quiet given city living :)  what more could you ask for!?

The place was clean and all amenities are as advertised. Couch was big and comfy and so was the bed. The internet and tv worked great. The balcony was cozy as well. Easy to fetch an Uber or cab as well, but as mentioned, everything you need is within walking distance."
227028,326665556,2018-09-22,42737532,Jeffrey,97,The apartment was very nice and beautiful but pls be aware that the communication with host and team might be a little bit hard

363278,2540946,2012-10-08,3502986,Jen,97,"Alan is a wonderful person and a fantastic host. I would highly recommend staying at Tiny Bluestone Cottage anytime :) Alan is extrememly kind and considerate, and the cottage is welcoming and quaint. Plus Jack (the dog) and Amy (the cat) add extra character and comfort to an already lovely environment. 
Whenever I visit Melbourne I hope to stay with Alan again! "
72576,475204950,2019-06-24,202158841,Jen,100,Amazing.

Kate was the perfect host, a great conversationalist and happy to help out with suggestions.  The room was lovely and clean and had everything he needed.  We will definitely stay with Kate again!"
72576,4079569,2013-04-08,872960,Jen,97,"Ramona's place is in the perfect location for someone travelling to Melbourne without a car. It's just off Gertrude st (we found our favourite lunch spot here), and is close enough to walk into the city, or to Brunswick st! There's at least 2 tram lines that are super close by if you don't feel like waking too. The house itself is beautiful and you certainly have some privacy being on your own level. We really enjoyed lazing about on the balconies on the 2nd floor after a long day walking around the city. Ramona was a great host. Very willing to help us out with directions etc, but also gave us privacy and mostly left us to our own devices. She also brought home yummy muffins and bread from the local bakery!!! :) We had such a great stay, thank you. "
38271,3340598,2013-01-13,4377922,Jen,94,"What a great find!  Daryl and Dee thank you so much for being so welcoming and such delightful hosts.  We wished we didn't have to go so quickly.....we could have chatted for hours I'm sure!  The accommodation exceeded our expectations.  So hope we can get back there one day.  We wish you every beautiful thing in life and pray the Lord continues to bless the work of your hands.  Jen, Graham and Ebony"

Very comfortable and cosy bedroom with everything you could need.  Transport virtually on your doorstep and parking right outside the cottage.
I couldn't have picked a better place to stay, would definitely recommend and stay again, thank you Alan, your a real gem."
150729,11218642,2014-03-25,631555,Jenn,97,"This was the perfect place to stay during my time in Melbourne!  Ramona's home is right in the heart of Fitzroy (the best neighborhood, in my opinion!) within a short walking distance of all the best cafes in the city.  The place is lovely, full of wonderful vintage details and little extras that made it a truly special place to call home for a few nights.  Ramona is a very attentive host and made sure I found my way there easily, and even helped call me a cab upon departure!  My room was as described and very comfortable.  Highly recommend staying here!"
189406,364986600,2018-12-31,13130102,Jenna,99,"The space was lovely, clean and stylish. The apartment is in a great location; on a quiet street but close by to local bars and cafes. Danielle and Ruth were communicative, responsive and kind to deal with. The check-in process was a breeze, and I would happily stay in the apartment again or recommend it to a friend."
161033,168106112,2017-07-09,50668871,Jenna,97,"We had a lovely stay, nice and quiet with an abundance of wild life, Kangaroos, Kookaburra and parrots."
47100,3616829,2013-02-26,1214840,Jenni,97,"Loren and Ruth are uber-hosts. Communication beforehand was helpful and on arrival everything was easy and handy  - eg tram cards, maps and recommendations and cozy with great decor, including fabulous art by friends on the walls. Almost did not see either Loren or Ruth, despite being there at the same time as we were all out and about - but was thankful to cross paths as both super lovely and fun. I'm sure I'll be back sometime. "
288147,23939084,2014-12-15,21124831,Jennie,97,"Angel promises to provide you with Comfort and a Great experience and she certainly delivers.  My in-laws from England needed a room near our house and Angels was perfect for their needs.  They enjoyed her company, raved about the room and will stay again on their annual visit to us.  Thanks for making our lives easier in more ways than one."
16760,12155212,2014-04-24,13245415,Jennie,91,Clement House is exactly what it said it would be. We loved staying here. Colin and Chung were friendly and helpful. Recommended :)
76867,5189694,2013-06-17,6563476,Jennie,100,Great apartment stay and great location with easy tram access to the CBD. Judy was very friendly and accommodating. Excellent communication at all stages before the stay and it was convenient to be able to pick up the key at her workplace. The place was clean and the bed was comfy. Lovely to have my own bathroom. A very pleasant first airbnb experience.
313648,6283985,2013-08-06,1553365,Jennie,100,"Haydn was prompt to respond to my initial inquiry about his apartment and continued to be quick to respond before and during my stay. The apartment has a great kitchen which we used a lot. Wifi is great. Having secure parking was really handy. It was quite cold for our time in Melbourne and as the apartment has separate rooms, it is hard for the air conditioner to heat the whole apartment. Haydn quickly provided a second heater when I asked for one. The apartment is in a lovely area of Melbourne - it is quiet at night and you can walk through beautiful Fitzroy Gardens to the city. Also you are not far from outlet shopping on Bridge Road. We found a great cafe on the corner of New and York Streets (New York Tomato) where the coffee and the breakfast were great.  There are a few train stations close by, as well as trams. Overall, we had a very good stay."
215787,2647392,2012-10-18,3160004,Jennie,96,We thoroughly enjoyed our stay at this apartment.  It is a home away from home with all sorts of personal touches you wouldn't find normally.  The apartment is in a great location and the pictures don't do it justice.  It was very clean and tidy and has everything you need.  The host even rang us from France to make sure everything was OK which impressed us.  We were able to extend our stay which was wonderful as it made things so much easier. We would stay here again if we need to in the future. Geoff and Jennie
111001,358548733,2018-12-14,21969300,Jennie,83,"Yulia is patient, fun, and super interesting to talk to! She took us around tiny alleyways that we would otherwise never discover on our own and the pictures turned out awesome! Definitely recommend the group photo walk and would do it again in a heartbeat."
75109,121059206,2016-12-13,63490747,Jennifer,95,A lively house with wonderful kids and lovely pets. The room we stayed was nice and comfortable. We loved to play pool and play/stroke with the pets.
363278,44802729,2015-08-29,2853692,Jennifer,100,"Alan is a charming host, and the cottage must be one of the cutest places in Melbourne. It was perfectly situated for what I needed just off Smith Street in a quiet cul de sac. It is a real haven. And the dog Jack is a lovely boy. My first experience with Ai (Website hidden by Airbnb) and it was a great experience. Thanks Alan, and Jack."
363278,30711486,2015-04-26,20971915,Jennifer,100,"Alan was a wonderful host. His place is comfortable and he was very accommodating. He even offered breakfast each morning and drove me to my destination on the last day! Fitzroy is a really cute neighborhood to explore, and this location was convenient walking distance to all the shops and restaurants as well as the tram that goes downtown. "
247006,11305581,2014-03-29,9625731,Jennifer,93,"Another 5 star Air BnB experience! Lovely room with comfy bed & superb breakfast with quality ingredients. A great place to stay in a pleasant part of a beautiful city.
Chris is a congenial & thoughtful host. I really appreciated his helpful tips and suggestions on sightseeing & eating out in the city. 
If I am ever lucky enough to return to Melbourne, I would really like to stay here again. Thank you very much, Chris."
10803,17708099,2014-08-16,2838033,Jennifer,96,"Conveniently located near the tram stop. 
Comfortable room. 
Relaxed and friendly host who has an amazing aesthetic and interesting collectibles. "
38271,104283845,2016-09-26,35451613,Jennifer,0,Dee & Daryl were great hosts! The place was tidy & comfortable. They were nice enough to supply tea & toast in the morning which is great and convenient when you are only have the one night stay. Thank you for having us! Would 100% stay again!
72576,116578868,2016-12-01,8022749,Jennifer,95,"Everything was well organised before I arrived, communication was good and check-in went smoothly. There is a good collection of high quality teas and spreads in the kitchen and nice shampoo, conditioner and shower gel in the bathroom. There is, however, a somewhat odd atmosphere in the house. On some of the days I was there loud music blared mysteriously from the living room in the early evening which reverberated straight up into the bedroom on the third floor. It can also be difficult to get big luggage up and down the stairs as they are steep and narrow and lined with decorations (not shown in the photos). Overall, my stay wasn't bad but the place wasn't really my cup of tea."
252381,232011639,2018-02-03,121295761,Jennifer,96,Fabulous second stay! Would return again and again. Thanks for having me again Frank and Vince. Loved it just as much as the first time :)
51592,16337415,2014-07-26,9139356,Jennifer,95,Fantastic apartment! Plenty of shopping and restaurants right outside your door. Located in the heart of the CBD. Michelle was a great host and very helpful. Would love to come back and stay here again!
74548,355090086,2018-12-02,29352425,Jennifer,98,Friendly and chatty host. Guest will enjoy stay with Mario as he makes people feel like home.
252381,225550181,2018-01-06,121295761,Jennifer,95,"Great apartment in a wonderful location. Everything is at your doorstep, great cafes, restaurants, supermarket and only 5 mins walk to the beach. I will miss my morning coffee and breakfast runs to Bunker Spreckles and Veruca Salt as well as being able to pop up and back from the  beach. The neighbors are also really friendly. The apartment stayed cool even  during the 40 degree day we had as long as you close the blinds like the hosts recommend. Would definitely stay again. Thanks for having me."
150729,5753544,2013-07-15,6019628,Jennifer,98,"I arranged the stay for my in-laws and they absolutely loved Ramona's appartment. Ramona was a pleasure to deal with, and is extremely thoughtful. When I arrived to meet my in-laws at her appartment, she had laid out clean bathrobes, towels and a little welcome note for them on their bed, and maps and guides for Fitzroy and Melbourne on their bedside. It was all the small touches that I loved - fresh flowers in their room and a small heater to help them warm up if needs be. Ramona's appartment is just amazing, and the location is perfect. For anyone seeking to stay in Melbourne with more of a local feel, this appartment is for you!"
150729,27506190,2015-03-06,138245,Jennifer,88,"I cannot say enough good things about my stay. Fitzroy is one of the coolest parts of Melbourne - coffee shops, cool clothes and hipsters for days. You are right in the middle of things flanked by Gertrude St, Smith St, and Brunswick - plus easy access to the city and other sights via the Tram. The apartment is just gorgeous - even better than pictured. As Ramona is an experienced host, she's already thought of all the things that could make your stay easier. It was truly seamless.

Also, Ramona is the coolest. Period. "
247140,6052637,2013-07-28,6812832,Jennifer,0,"I would definately recommend Fiona's apartment for anyone looking for a place to stay in Melbourne!
Beautiful area, great apartment, close to city and public transport, wonderful host who provides detailed and fuss-free instructions.
Especially loved the complimentary bottle of red that greeted us upon arrival :)"

75109,47132915,2015-09-15,11101159,Jennifer,0,"Karen welcomed us into her home, as did her exuberant children, and even more exuberant dog. Despite the very short notice (we booked in the morning, checked in that afternoon), she was flexible in terms of our arrival time, and kept in touch via messaging (accommodating our uncertain schedule).

The neighbourhood is quiet and felt safe, but not too far from the city (we had a car ‚Äì can't comment on public transport). There was ample on-street parking. We unfortunately didn't get to spend much time at the house, but the listing is accurate: a warm, comfy home. There were also thoughtful little extras like toiletries, and water in the fridge.

After a couple of weeks of camping and backpacking, Karen's home was indeed a ""cosy oasis"" :) Would definitely recommend staying here."
284210,18882207,2014-09-02,8406060,Jennifer,91,"Kate made me feel very welcome, she is a vibrant and cheerful person with a real willingness to chat and make you feel at home. She ensured I was comfortable and had access to everything I required, and made room for my bits and pieces in the kitchen and bathroom. The apartment is as represented, really well positioned, close to lots of great eateries and cool shops in Brunswick St, and close to tram lines.   Thanks Kate! I hope to see you again soon. "
10803,17394586,2014-08-11,15035042,Jennifer,99,"Lindsay is a gentle soul and I felt very safe being in his home.
He was thoughtful and had the lamp and heater on for when I arrived which I really appreciated.
The location is perfect with the tram just outside the door.
The room was surprisingly quiet given the location and even the hotel directly opposite stopped their music just after midnight on Saturday so it wasn't a bother.
The room is spacious.
It is an old inner suburb property with the inherent narrow steps and old plumbing.  The kitchen, lounge and bathroom did not seem to have much spare space, but if you are not planning on sitting around inside all day it was a bed at a great price.

I found the bathroom probably needed some handiman love but I know landlords are not always as interested in tiles missing and broken taps as we are."
43429,29507333,2015-04-08,29014638,Jennifer,97,Liz and Allan greeted us warmly and were very helpful. The apartment is lovely and in a quiet location. All the little 'extras' were greatly appreciated.

43429,28889522,2015-03-31,27453460,Jennifer,40,"Melbourne's best kept secret, and we are able to share it with you.  What a find!  This was the first time we used AirBnb, and we hit gold with Allan's little hideaway.  Communication with Allan was easy, both prior to our arrival and during our stay.  The little extras that Allan provided were totally unexpected.  eg bread, butter, breakfast cereal, milk, tea, coffee, chocolates, orange juice.  Facilities were exemplary.  Location suited our purposes.  Close to supermarket, takeaway, laundromat, asnd public transport.   
Off street parking provided.    We would highly recommend this little hideaway, and would certainly book here again, if ever in Melbourne. "
51592,437661399,2019-04-15,25439685,Jennifer,95,"Michelle‚Äôs warehouse apartment is an extraordinary space in the very heart of gorgeous Melbourne. And that‚Äôs not hyperbole! Relaxing by the massive windows yesterday morning, autumn sun streaming through, with a coffee from 359 (a few paces away) and feeling like I could touch the striking GPO clock tower was a truly Melbourne experience. Huge, quirky and so close to everywhere we needed to be, Michelle‚Äôs apartment will inspire and delight. A responsive and generous host, Michelle was brilliant to deal with. Many thanks for a memorable few days in your amazing warehouse. xx"

The apartment was positioned perfectly for our weeks stay  - walking distance to lots of great breakfast and evening restaurants.

Make sure you bring some earplug if you are a sensitive sleeper. Cause it‚Äôs located on the main streets, it can be a bit loud outside."
310594,122052158,2016-12-20,19770560,Jennifer,100,"This is a quirky three storey flat which truly reflects the owner and her world. The most enjoyable spot is relaxing on the snuggler sofa watching the parrots and nightly migrations of the bats - or the television which is appropriately placed for a great view. 
This is not one of those corporate airbnb apartment listings but really someone's home generously opened and shared with visitors -  the way it should be. 
We found it a little warm after a day of the sun beating through the balcony French windows without air con but we are from a Scotland and definitely not acclimatised to a hot summer! 
A lovely space to relax and perfect for getting sun and light throughout the day. "
43429,350657982,2018-11-19,27453460,Jennifer,84,"This is the third time we have stayed at Allan‚Äôs.  The apartment suits our needs, particularly the off street parking."

As others have said the accommodation is lovely, quiet, spacious and modern with great views in a quiet area not far from the zoo.Gloria was very helpful in offering transport advice and a pick up from her local station. We would certainly like to stay again if we are ever back in Melbourne and would thoroughly recommend Gloria's."

Our room was lovely, the bed was really comfortable and she had added thoughtful touches like fresh flowers and local artisan chocolate.  Her whole house is stunning and it was a privilege to stay there. The house is perfectly situated in the heart of Fitzroy which was ideal for us as it was ramned with brilliant places to eat, drink and hang out.

Fitzroy is the best neighbourhood in the city - vibrant and friendly and full of a diverse range of shops and fantastic bars and eateries. (It's also an easy walk or short tram ride to the central city). The studio is in a quiet lane that's really conveniently located. It's also full of character, much better than staying in an anonymous apartment. Lulu is really friendly and full of helpful local knowledge about the neighbourhood. Highly recommended. "

74548,3661863,2013-03-01,1259070,Jeremy,100,My stay at Mario's place coincided with him being away so we only met on the last day and I can confirm all that is said about Mario on the other reviews. Melb city can be very noisy at night and any high rise apartment gets the noise but the view is compensation. Great value. 
74548,418308178,2019-03-01,44344329,Jeremy,96,Nice place and location. Mario is a thoughtful kind person and made me feel welcome! I walked pretty much everywhere from the apartment - it was extremely central and easy to access. Nice also have a pool and work out room!

Welcoming and warm, great to talk to and be around; really nice, genuine people with old-world manners.  I was brand new to Melbourne, and Toni and David were great with filling me in on the sorts of information a new person is curious about.

The room I stayed in came with access to my own bathroom (which was a huge plus), and was air conditioned.  Very easy 10-15 minute walk to Camberwell train station, which then gets you to Swinburne University or the city very quickly.  There‚Äôs a washing machine and doing laundry there is very easy.  Wifi for emails and browsing (not for downloading big files).

I‚Äôd definitely recommend  staying with Toni and her family to anyone, and definitely to anyone who is looking to be near Swinburne; it‚Äôs a very nice way to spend some time in Melbourne.

363278,3435198,2013-01-29,4162110,Jerome,96," I felt comfortable staying at Alan's Place. It was very homey and cozy, clean and nicely located. Woolworths Supermarket is within the vicinity, tram stop is two blocks away,  and heaps of funky shops, art galleries, cafes, and bars around. Alan is a true gentleman, a fantastic host and a great person to chat with. I have a wonderful time staying at Alan's home. I highly recommend experiencing it when you travel to Melbourne.

16760,3479925,2013-02-05,4162110,Jerome,85,Colin and Chung are very nice people. Chung is chatty and friendly and made sure my stay was comfortable. The house itself is beautiful. The room that I stayed at is spacious and has a great view of the street outside. 
263871,33770855,2015-06-01,3038861,Jerome,93,"Eliisa, was a perfect host, responsive and well backed up by her local support.

Her apartment was roomy and warm, amazing water pressure in the shower, and a little Juliet balcony that I'll really miss.

The location is second to none, a couple minutes walk to the mall and trams on Elizabeth St and Bourke St, and great restaurants in Hardware Lane just a few more minutes away.

There is some noise, though it is in the middle of a city, and the convenience of being so central more than makes up for it.

Internet is fast, and reliable enough to use to work, and the TV now has a new antenna with perfect reception.

We would definitely stay again!"

The location is really convenient in the CBD, giving us easy access to the free tram system and more time to explore the beautiful city. It also makes for a conveniently short walk to the grocery store, the beautiful State Library (I would be happy spending days in there), or nearby hotels where tour operators can pick us up early in the morning. We do have to share the guest restroom, but that is a small inconvenience considering how seldom we are at home, the benefit of having Sharyn's hospitality, and generous pet therapy from Roger :). Thanks again for making our stay enjoyable!"

47100,6639045,2013-08-19,7494575,Jess,97,Loren and Ruth are lovely and accomodating hosts.  Their cute little flat is very close to the tram lines and very easy to get to everywhere I wanted to go.  A tempting taste into what it would be like to live in inner city Melbourne.  i only wish I had more time there!  Also as I am from Queensland I apreciated how warm and cosy the flat is.  Turns out electric blankets rock :)  Thanks ladies!

It was just magic coming back from dinner and seeing at least 30 kangaroos sitting directly outside the cabin. Karen and Michael are lovely hosts - we had a nice chat and then they left us to our own devices, which is exactly the type of Airbnb experience I like. Karen had picked us some cherries off their lovely tree but I still couldn't help pinching a few extra every time I walked past it! Highly recommend."

Very safe area and the house is planned amazingly - I stayed on the top level with my own bathroom, balcony and a study nook, it was perfect. Bed super comfortable too. Ramona is a brilliant host, she was travelling when I came to stay but she was always in communication and very helpful.  I will be back here every time I visit Melbourne!"

The apartment is on an adorable, quiet street right next to Carlton Gardens. It's adorably furnished and clean. And -- bonus -- I found the bed to be remarkably comfortable. I'll be staying here every time I'm in Melbourne and recommending it to friends."

Well-equipped kitchen and nice big dining table for dinner in. Big windows and lots of natural light, surrounded by trees and plants. Easy exploring! Walk to the Melbourne Museum or to the free city center tram to head downtown. The apartment is a little older and was a bit chilly in the wintertime. Host brought in an extra heater to accommodate us."

Even just passing through the beautiful foyer is part of the experience. Do yourself and favor and stay a few nights, don't forget to have some breakfast downstairs and pick up some yummy mochi from the Supermarket across the street! *nom*nom*"

288147,27021900,2015-02-23,25420258,Jessica,100,A lovely house in a good area. Enjoyed meeting the other guests.

Only downside is noise - morning street noise and some boisterous nights. But that pales in comparison to how awesome the place and the location is."
12936,369001465,2019-01-08,19943767,Jessica,98,"Apartment was exactly as the photos. Great set up and appreciated the well supplied kitchen. As we had a long stay we appreciated having access to extra towels whilst we washed ours etc. location was perfect for us and easy to get into and out of the building. Communication was always quick and easy. Only negative that we were disappointed in, was the lack of cleanliness on arrival. As we paid over $100- for a cleaning fee we did expect the place to be well cleaned on arrival. This was not the case. I dusted all surfaces myself, some had obviously not been done in a long time. The main issue was the floor tiles. My son got very dirty crawling around in the first few hours. Having said that, I very much appreciated having access to a vacuum and mop and I easily rectified the situation myself. Thanks for having us and we would happily stay again."
72576,6028242,2013-07-27,1589230,Jessica,98,Beautiful place! Perfect location! Amazing and very helpful host! :-) we stayed here for 2 nights and we would definitely stay again.

50492,346226533,2018-11-07,69746439,Jessica,95,"Hubby and I stayed here with our 4yo and 5 month old. We had a lovely time. The apartment is clean and stylish. The lush green wall in the courtyard makes it feel like a private haven. As a family we happily stayed in most nights and had the kitchen basics required to cook a meal and a washer/dryer. There‚Äôs no bath but it didn‚Äôt worry us. Communication with the hosts was great. 

Fitzroy Rd was a 3-4 min downhill stroll away, where we could get a tram to the city, and grab what we needed from Woolworths. The beach was a 10 minute walk (or short tram) and we enjoyed visiting the penguins one evening. Luna Park and Ackland St was an easy 10 min in the other direction and has lots of food options, park fun and a market on sundays. 

If travelling with kids, be sure to check out St Kilda Adventure playground. It‚Äôs only about 250m away and tucked in a back street. Open times are limited so check the website but it‚Äôs free and great fun. 

Despite its reputation for backpackers and the red light district, our family had a great time in St Kilda. And Frank and Vince‚Äôs place was a great base for our adventures."

108032,132603071,2017-02-18,41355085,Jessica,94,"Malcolm's place was great! Really clean, comfortable and there were so many extra touches (like fresh OJ in the fridge, snacks, wine, toiletries, vouchers, books and dvds). Malcolm was a fantastic host, easy to communicate with and very friendly. The only thing is that the Internet in the apartment is a little bit slow (which didnt bother us at all) but if you were planning on doing lots of work online or having a massive netflix binge it might be a bit frustrating. We will definitely be looking up Malcolm's place the next time we plan a Melbourne trip :) "

The place was spotless and had sufficient amenities for a comfortable stay. Hosts Karen and Michael were warm and friendly and even gave us tips on things to do around the area when the weather turned grey. Excellent communication and easy to find location. We enjoyed seeing the kangaroos on the property and the breakfast items left in a basket for us were a thoughtful touch. Thank you Karen and Michael for having us!

It was our first stop in Australia so it was really comforting the first night we spent there to sit in the garden while Rob played guitar and Diana was gardening. The next day we all went out to a shopping centre together and the next morning they drove us into the city. We could not of asked for more welcoming hosts, very friendly and helpful - would defiantly recommend to anyone wishing to stay in the area.  "

He gave me great advice and helped me find my way around.  The apartment was in a great location, literally the tram into the CBD(20min) and St. Kilda Beach (45min) was less than a minute walk from the doorstep.  For any yoga or capoeira enthusiasts, there was a lovely studio downstairs and outside there were two cafes, a bottle shop and a milk bar (small market).

My bf and I love the stay so much! We will rate it as good as a 5 stars hotel! (Its better than hotels!!!!)We even spent our night by watching her DVD :P 

Strategic location is a big plus point. Just a few mins walk will lead u to free tram zone. Super convenient!!! Its a bit dim for the walkway at night, but is safe! 

We highly recommend to stay with Ramona! The accommodation and the host the best so far from our experiences!

The location was the most quiet from my experiences with accomodations in Melbourne centre, yet it was within walking distance from all the shops and transport. Everything necessary was provided. And if I had wanted to bake muffins, I could do so too! Camilla was very helpful and left useful materials about Melbourne attractions in the apartment. "

Ramona is very nice, hospitable and sweet. She replied to our questions very fast and gave us a great many useful tips. We really enjoyed our trip here. I'd like to stay here again if I come back to Melbourne."

Ramona has a treasure trove of vintage objects including numerous colorful weighing scales(!) and curious sports apparatus that I have not seen before in my life.

They make you feel as welcome as if it is your own home, and simply want to meet as many people as possible, bond over beers and just have fun - which is undoubtedly the best way to run an Air Bnb. Being backpackers, looking to explore Melbourne while we work, Ryan gave us lots of tips for the best eateries, hang out spots and vibes in Melbourne. You can get to the CBD within half an hour, which is nothing when you're in a house as beautiful as Ryan and Rhiannon's. With the addition of their cute chocolate Lab Romeo! Without a doubt the best stay we've had in Melbourne, and we'll hopefully be back again!!"

The studio itself is beautifully decorated and furnished with fresh bunch of flowers and fruit and a bottle of wine and beers in the fridge. Perfect!

The location can not possibly be any better, it‚Äôs located only 20 seconds from the major road and tram station. Yet it‚Äôs very quiet and private. Only a few blocks away from the China town, GPO‚Ä¶ pretty much everything in the CBD area. When I was shopping in the city, I could keep going back to the studio to drop off the stuff since it was on the way.

Next time I‚Äôm in Melbourne for a long weekend, I will definitely try to stay here. Just hoping it will be available!

Thanks Malcolm for your hospitality."

We enjoyed their bar & spa and even shared their dinner one night! Even he helped us to book next stay in Melnourne. I really appriciated that. 
Their home is so modern and fantastic place. The room is very comfy and attention to detail was great. Place is beautifully decorated. Privacy was respected, but you can enjoy talking with them anytime in the bar(they have a small but beautiful bar in their home). So you can meet friends who enjoy in melbourne and you can exchange  some information and your story. 
I absulutely recommend staying with Ryan & Rhannon. I already recommended this place to my friends and we want to come back to their house with our parents for next holliday."

But this is home from home the facilities are excellent and we can only give praise Vicki has a lovely home. All the other guest are very friendly too.

Vicki will ensure your stay is wonderful and will go the extra mile to help you out. She has a drawer full of literature for seeing all the sights and she has lost of useful knowledge of the area.

Would we come back absolutely no hesitation.

The gluten bread was absolutely phenomenal, and a welcome treat to our long day, the selection of teas and coffee, and our own space upstairs was phenomenal. Thank you so much Ramona we truly appreciate the experience after our awful night in a dodgy hotel in St Kilda we were willing to sleep in a park lol. So grateful."

Her rooms are very central, so I got everywhere walking. I worked at the Melbourne conference center which is a 10-15 minutes walk. The city can be reached in the same time range.

Recommended highly."

It's perfectly located- close to everything that's best about Fitzroy- yet so quiet and peaceful. It was a beautiful space, warm and relaxing and like my own little retreat. Rebecca has great communication and gives clear and handy instructions/info on everything. I loved every moment and didn't want to leave. Already planning my return. Thank you for a truly excellent air bnb experience."

313648,8935132,2013-11-26,9900579,Jodie,93,"I couldn't have asked for a better first experience with Airbnb. Haydn was incredibly helpful and organised throughout our stay. The pre-arrival property guide was useful before and during our stay; giving us directions and different travel routes/options from the airport to the accommodation, and providing information of the local area. Our late arrival was easily managed, and we were given instructions, which were quick to follow. The apartment was clean, tidy and well-furnished. A large amount of effort can be seen to have been spent on this homely space -- especially the new kitchen bench-tops! Haydn courteously contacted us the day after we arrived to ensure that everything was going smoothly. It was an absolute pleasure staying at this apartment, and we would recommend it to all our family and friends! Thanks so much Haydn :)"

108032,2144183,2012-08-30,827255,Joe,94,"My girlfriend and I stayed in this cosy apartment for four nights during our recent trip to Melbourne. We found Malcolm and his wife very accommodating, friendly and ready with helpful information upon our arrival, and the apartment itself was neat and in an excellent central location. Being so close to many great places to eat and Federation Square really rounded out our getaway. We were concerned the apartment looked a little small but it turned out to be perfect for two people."

The house was incredible, and definitely worth the cost. Ramona also suggested some nice places for us to eat and was in touch by text whenever we needed her during the lead up to the trip until we left. The place is a 20 minute walk to the CBD, we basically walked everywhere it was that close. I would highly recommend staying at Little George.

Gloria's apartment was beautifully furnished and spotless - the room I stayed in was exactly as shown in the images. The bed was extremely comfortable and I had my own bathroom that had everything.
Gloria herself was the perfect host. She was extremely welcoming, very flexible about our schedules and the arrangements and strongly encouraged me to make myself at home. She was very happy to chat but also happy for us to each do our own thing in the living room in the evening, and the dynamic was very comfortable.
I can strongly recommend Gloria and her apartment if you are visiting Melbourne, and will certainly return myself the next time I have business in the area."

The cosy clean bungalow is by itself for privacy, en suite bathroom, Karen and Michael got everything you'll need during your stay. 
Be sure to meet the roos during evening time and adorable Scuffy came greeting you in the late evening just make sure you're nice and warm in the room.

Because it was last minute, everything was booked out solid and I was preparing to make tracks until I thought to give Airbnb a try. Vicki's place popped up and looked to good to be true. However, the many reviews of high praise are spot on and I lucked out to land a comfortable bed at her house.  The most important things for me were not necessarily related to the accommodation details (although they are great), but rather a safe place to park my vehicle and protect my valuables and this place was perfect.  Getting out of my tent for a few days was great and the value here versus the local caravan parks is much much better!"
67211,47825050,2015-09-21,40457794,John,96,"I would like to stay at Kate's when doing business in Melbourne.
It was easy getting trams and shops and Woolworth's were a short walk. It was quiet and a nice view from the bedroom window of quaint old buildings.
Only drawback for some may be three easy flights of stairs.
Lifts are often noisy anyway!

John is usually home so the only real privacy is in the bedroom, which is small but very cozy with good light. He is a very experienced host and loves to get to know his guests. Sometimes it felt a bit awkward chatting if I had to rush through making breakfast. Otherwise he is very sweet, attentive and thoughtful. I'd stay here again."
300679,10448274,2014-02-19,10234571,John,0,Julie was a gracious host and provided cozy accommodations in a quiet neighborhood outside of Melbourne. Also liked the fact that local bus stop was only 1 minute walk away to reach beach or local malls.

51592,1412707,2012-06-04,2194269,John,87,"My first experience with Airbnb and it was a very good one. Michelle was easy to deal with when we messaged and emailed. She was away when we stayed at her place so we didn't meet but everything was set in place before we got there. The location in the lane and stairs below the flat looked a bit weird at first (we arrived in the night) but the place itself was fantastic. We happened to get construction outside one Saturday morning  but not much you can do about that. 

The flat is big and fun (with a super shower) and everything else you would want, and the location can't be beat. Also, on the street off the laneway the flat is in is a Chinese shop called Shanghai Street. It always has a queue but go there and get the dumplings. And stay in Michelle's flat, it's gold."

150729,26672436,2015-02-17,18202714,John,94,Perfect advice on how to find the house. Keys ready. What a place. The road outside would in some cities think you were lost but then open the door and wow. Hugely airy house with airbandb rooms on ground and top floors with a fantastic living space in between. amazingly well laid out. Fridge with a great variety of fantastic breads. Our hostess friendly and kept in touch. Would highly recommend staying.
150729,148469358,2017-04-30,118295336,John,100,"Ramona is a warm, well organized and informed host, who provided me with many useful tips about how to successfully navigate my way around the delights of Fitzroy and beyond.  The accommodation was very clean and comfortable, and beautifully appointed with intriguing displays of collectables.  Ramona's place is within easy walking distance of a vast array of  venues which offer a smorgasbord of parks, streetscapes, live music, fine food, fashion, arts and crafts.  Access to the local tram network is close and makes exploration beyond the local area a breeze.  Thank you again Ramona and I look forward to staying with you again one day :) "

16760,24810623,2015-01-03,18634865,John,85,"The accommodation was as described, comfortable bed and private bathroom and lounge room. Shared kitchen.
Access to transport was fantastic, close to train (500m) and tram (200m), no need for a hire car unless you intend to take trips to Yarra Valley or Mornington Peninsular. It was less than a 10min train trip to central Melbourne.
Pubs and Cafes in the area were well priced and of good quality. 
Colin was most helpful with advise on local amenities and travel.
Would recommend.

76867,31475272,2015-05-05,31573837,John,98,"The apartment was as described.  Perfect location for my time in Melbourne.  Judy was the perfect host, knowledgeable, friendly, approachable and available.  Will stay again should the opportunity arise. "
268849,61967562,2016-02-09,43692429,John,85,"The apartment was immaculate and exactly as it was described and pictured in the photos - such is Mia's attention to detail that even the books were stacked in the same order in the same spot.  Mia was easy to deal with and responded promptly to any queries, making the -whole booking and check in process a breeze. "
257149,53635130,2015-11-10,47376182,John,87,"The flart was clean& comfortable. The position is very good with the train close by.  The car park is also a big plus.
There were a couple of concerns -  2 of the 3 downlights in the kitchen were not working and the shower rail fixture was very loose . There were no instructions for the dishwasher and no detergent provided.  Overall, with cleaning charge and airbnb service charges added,felt that the flat was a bit overpriced."
189434,215639608,2017-12-01,23928594,John,0,"The location is FANTASTIC. If you don't know Carlton, you should find out! Easy access to many shops and restaurants (great gelato too), as well as the tram into the city and beyond. In Carlton, check out Brunetti's and D.O.C., but really it's hard to go wrong.

The apartment was clean, spacious, modern, and comfortable, with many nice touches. The bed was especially comfortable, which was important for my wife and her back problems. The only potential issue (for some people) is that it is two floors up without a lift -- only a problem for us when moving heavy suitcases up and down and then not a big problem.

Altogether, a great place for a couple to stay. You could have more people in a pinch, but it would get crowded."
300679,478285826,2019-06-29,49115646,John,100,This experience is the perfect way to see the Garden of Gods!  E-bikes make it accessible for all levels of fitness and biking experience!  Leave the car traffic behind and book this now!  Conor was a very fun guide!
120487,177151436,2017-08-02,27080645,John,93,"This was a bad experience for me. The place was damaged.. Window locks, power point and no smoke alarms. The air conditioning was terrible and even after hours the room was freezing. There was no top sheet on the bed, no instructions on how to access wifi or tv. The main info the owner gave was how bad the last tenants were.
The ad reads beautifully but it was way overpriced for what it seemed to be. I also question how legal it is to have insufficient heating and smoke alarms."
150729,237399394,2018-02-22,118295336,John,100,"This was my second stay at Ramona's place and again I found the Little George Street location to be an excellent base for my stay in Melbourne, with excellent access to the CBD, the University of Melbourne Parkville campus and the various delights of Fitzroy.   The neighbor hood is quiet and the house is clean and stylish.  Ramona is an excellent host and a wealth of excellent tips regarding where to go, what to see and how to get there - thanks for suggesting Heartattack and Vine to me Remona, an excellent end to my most recent stay."

257915,400685987,2019-01-12,198063453,John,100,"We booked 3 apartments through Dina at her Melbourne location. Overall, as a group of 15 we were extremely happy with the value and location of the apartments. We knew it wasn't going to be 5 star, however were very surprised and happy with the nice conditions of all of them. Couldn't recommend highly enough if you needed cheap accommodation  to house large groups so close to the city, the casino and or course Southbank. Dina was a pleasure to deal with and a great host."
247006,10577931,2014-02-25,4524520,John,98,"We enjoyed our stay with Chris very much.  He was most helpful in helping us sort out our transport options from the airport, as well as separating the tourist hangouts from those preferred by locals in his neighborhood, a big plus in our book.  His other travel tips for this lovely city were spot on.  His home is a short walking distance from the tram stop which runs from the CBD to St. Kilda's beach (#122), a vibrant destination.  His breakfast was very wholesome & sustaining, just what one needs to get a good jump touring this pleasant city.  We would add that his neighborhood is quite peaceful & has a lot of beautiful period architecture.  We highly recommend a stay with Chis."

You are right in the best part of the city for cafes, restaurants and entertainment. the trams are close and if you are in a hurry the soup from the cafe at ground level to take back is just great. Thank you, we will be back."

161033,25165435,2015-01-08,472637,Jolene,97,"Very cozy cabin with loads of privacy. Karen's husband was there to greet us and help us settle in on the day we arrived. The cabin came with basic necessities, as well as simple breakfast items Karen prepared. It was also a treat to have kangaroos grazing around the lawn one evening! Overall, a very comfortable and pleasant experience staying here."

Mario is a really nice guy with a great sense of humour and is a brilliant host, he made me fresh coffee every morning and let me check out late and use the apartment until my flight in the evening.

72576,22579666,2014-11-10,17171099,Jon,97,"This was a great experience.  Ramona was out and about for much of the time, but so friendly and helpful when we did run into each other.  She gave us an excellent food suggestion while we were in also.

The house is very nice, and extremely comfortable.  Plus, you can't beat the location.  Right next to endless shops and delicious food, and a short walk to the tram to get to many other parts of Melbourne.

I'd stay again in a heartbeat.  Thanks for a great time Ramona!"

The apartment itself is such an experience: with the swing, rooftop, and the charming character of the warehouse conversion; all my guests and I were absolutely enthralled by the everything. Situated almost in the center of the CBD, you cannot ask for a better location. It was close to public transport and to numerous fantastic restaurants and cafes. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone visiting Melbourne as it easily showcases the best that Melbourne has to offer.

It is in a great location depending on what you want; Elwood is a lovely leafy suburb. 
The place is very close to the train station/ trams and there's a great little set of shops nearby with dining/ coffee/ supermarket/ alcohol etc then a bit further away is the main Elwood shopping area.  The beach is also within walking distance."

The apartment is in a great location close to all the bars, restaurants and shops. I took the skybus directly from the airport and it dropped me off right outside the entrance. Mario wasn't in when I arrived but he had left the keys with the concierge staff so there was no hassle at all. The room was very comfortable and had the added bonus of an en-suit shower room. When Mario got home he made me feel very welcome and even took the time to give me a mini tour of the surrounding area (even though it was getting late). In short, I would definitely stay again and would recommend Mario's apartment to anyone. "

150729,91706007,2016-08-06,2657243,Josh,100,"First of all, the location is fantastic. It is maybe 2 minutes to the hippest street in Fitzroy, with plenty of high quality restaurants and cafes and indie stores.
Second of all, Ramona is a great host; as a first time visitor in Melbourne, she made me feel welcome by providing useful tips and attending to my needs, both expected and unexpected.
Lastly, can I just say the house itself is an attraction in Fitzroy! Highly recommended to all visitors in Melbourne if you are looking for a good value for money place to stay."
268849,365938236,2019-01-02,161167658,Josh,100,Good little place in a good location. Great responses from Mia at all stages. Price was a bit high but expected over NYE. Thank you :)

76867,216453516,2017-12-03,156645441,Josh,77,Judy keeps a very nice home and is very knowledgeable of the area. Floods shut down a lot of the area for a few days and Judy still knew where all the fun spots would be. Made the trip that much more fun!
47100,8031570,2013-10-13,4368426,Josh,99,"Loren rocked our socks off. Super energetic, witty, and a great help to a couple travelers looking to make their home in Melbourne for a year. She knows a ton about the city and has well deserved her 100+ reviews. Bed is really comfortable, WiFi works fine, and plenty of hot water. And the location can't be beat. Right off Bridge Rd...which is jam packed with cafes and restaurants. A stone's throw from Victoria with more Vietnamese than you can imagine. And trams are 2 min walk away...which take you right into the city and all points imaginable. Seriously, stay here. "

We arrived to an immaculate and light-filled Treehouse apartment were pleasantly surprised by fresh towels left for us on the bed etc. The apartment itself is super quiet despite being so conveniently located - which, for us, was the main selling point. Fitzroy is a phenomenal area for a quick visit to Melbourne. 
I spent most of my time at the exceptionally good record stores which were just a 10 minute walk away (Polyester / Northside / Dixon Recycled), we loved crawling to Slowpoke for coffee each morning. Industry Bean also does excellent coffee and unique breakfasts. 

All in all, as our first Airbnb experience, it "

189434,6155889,2013-08-01,7178242,Josie,95,Great location and easy to get to - near tramlines and good restaurants.  For a small space the layout was functional and enjoyable to be in. My 1 year old is crawling and walking around the edges of furniture and we found it to be a 'safe' space for her. We were able to watch DVDs in bed while she slept in the other room in the portacot provided - so there was no issue with thin walls/travelling noise like there has been in other places we've stayed. The washer with a dryer was really handy and the apartment was very clean and kitted out with everything we needed. Would recommend this to friends.

363278,2846966,2012-11-09,1803904,Joy,87,"Alan's hospitality is impeccable. His location is totally unbeatable for culture-lovers.

I spent 3 nights in his very quaint Bluestone 'Hobbit' House so I can be right smack in the heart of Fitzroy. Johnston Street where the clubs and bars are is a 10-15min walk away. Brunswick Street and Gertrude Street, where heaps of vintage clothing stores and cafes are located, are a 5-10 minute walk away. There is tram (86) from the City that stops right outside his street. Super convenient. I even walked to the city and it was a leisurely 20min walk, with amazing buildings and sculptures along the way. Also, the gorgeous Carlton Gardens and Museum of Melbourne is also about a 15min walk away from his place.

You'll be well-taken care of by Alan: he is charming, charismatic, well-humoured, and knowledgable. He'll prepare breakfast for you if you ask nicely and treat Jack and Amy well! Alan's great. Awesome to converse with. I can't recommend his place more!"
16760,2923375,2012-11-19,2186418,Joy,92,"Colin is located just a block away from where I needed to be and it was perfect.    A quiet room (double glazing) with a comfortable bed gave a good sleep.    In the morning, the breakfast table provided a wide variety to choose from with coffee to kick start me on my journey.   Interesting conversation with fellow travellers at the table.   Colin was attentive to details to make my trip enjoyable.   Thank you Colin and Chung."

The room was bigger than I thought it would be with its own bathroom which had both shower and lovely deep tub
Her modern deluxe building has a gym, pristine clean indoor lap pool.
An outdoor tennis court. Tram and coffee bars 8 mins off, even the ferry to Tasmania.
Beach and long beach boardwalk across the street. We rented bikes and took advantage of this fantastic location basically a lovely small neighborhood within 10mins tram ride to CBD

We were not prepared for the freezing weather and I really have to say a big thank you to our awesome hosts! 

Accomodation wise, the house was clean and breakfast well provided for. Heater was available till before we slept but the rooms can get cold during the night. 

Overall, we are pretty satisfied. :)"

There were great books, especially useful a guide to the Melbourne laneways. There is an excellent Italian cafe across the lane for that early morning caffeine fix or late night bowl of delicious pasta. Everything was right on the doorstep.

Eevi and Malcolm were very welcoming to me and understanding about my need to defer my arrival by four days due to the sudden onset of a devastating 'flu episode. 
I am accustomed to being very independent but it was lovely to see them there when I arrived in the evening and to have them introduce me to the apartment. Thank you Eliisa for loaning me your home.  I recommend it to others who enjoy being in a central location.

244952,142358757,2017-04-07,70727085,Julia,94,We absolutely adored staying at the treehouse. It totally lives up to its name being surrounded by beautiful big trees and although one of a big apartment block it felt very private. It was a perfect size for the 2 of us and so nice to retire back to after a big day exploring the city and Fitzroy (mostly by foot as everything is so close by!). We loved being able to stroll down to a cafe for breakfast and then down through Carlton gardens to the city. The apartment itself was so cozy and beautifully decorated. We just wish we could have stayed longer! Definitely recommend to anyone wanting a little Melbourne city get away.

Walter marked my first morning in Melbourne after a long drive from Sydney with a huge fragrant omelette breakfast, and the stay went from strength to strength after that. When I decided to brave the nocturnal traffic to ride to the ukulele club some suburbs away, Amanda went the extra mile to lend me her bike and lights to ensure I got there in one piece. Their cherubic baby son was a delight to behold. 

The room was very quiet, spacious and private, and I had the freedom to come and go at any time as I pleased. A cosy gas fire greeted me each night after I returning from yet another amazing Melb adventure, and it was just wonderful to flop down on the couch and chew the fat with two very relaxed locals.

Although so close to all of this the warehouse apartment is in a quiet street with no street noise whatsoever.   Gertrude, Brunswick and Smith Streets are all close by offering endless opportunities to explore this creative, lively neighbourhood.  The apartment is well set up with a good kitchen with lots of kitchen equipment, comfortable sofas and beds and lovely ethical toiletries to use in all rooms.    It is a very easy tram ride into central Melbourne but you can also walk in cutting through pretty Fitzroy Gardens.  The only problem I would mention is there is very little insulation between floors and therefore noise from above, but Hoang and her family took care to limit this, and definitely there was no problem later in the evenings.  Also I believe they are taking steps to have this fixed.    If this is not an issue for you I would definitely recommend a stay here.  "

It was such pleasure to stay with Viktoria and Joseph. They are such friendly and welcoming host. The room as well as the house, the garden are so beautiful, clean & tidy. Feeling peaceful & relaxing when staying there. Nice place & nice people. When we woke up, breakfast was ready. I was surprised because I didn't expect breakfast to be included. We had a nice chat together before we left for our trip again. What a lovely experience! I will definitely stay here again if I come around the area again next time!"

Since it was very hard to find a reasonable price for hotel, we opted to go for AirBnb. My only basis for booking with the host were past reviews from other guest who have stayed in her place. Those positive reviews meet even our expectation. My son even don't want to move to our permanent place  because he feels that was already a home! Special thanks to Tita Angel for taking care of us while we are at her place.

Mia was so much considerate that we felt like we were staying in our own home. She was very responsive to almost all enquiries we've had during our stay. 

Location was indeed great. It was close to great restaurants (and it was really nearby) and pubs (for Fridays). Walks to Fawkner & Royal Botanic Gardens were within 10 mins. 

I am definitely coming back here whenever I have opportunities!"

It was a cold evening but the heating was on so it was lovely and warm inside. There was a starter breakfast for the next day. Great coincidence that our hosts came from the same part of England that we did, but unfortunately we didn't have much time to chat. We enjoyed our stay.

We we were a bit apprehensive as it was our first airbnb stay, but I think this was about as good as it gets.  This is the best area in Melbourne, regardless of whether you are there for work, culture, shopping or dining, and one of the best little apartments.  
Access was easy, instructions were clear, the local tips were handy (even for someone who is a regular visitor) and the apartment was very well presented. 
Note that  it can be lively at night (but not that late and it is why you want to be here), and you can get unlucky with service deliveries and collection some mornings.  While there is no AC, the abundance of windows makes it unnecessary."

Location of the apartment was just perfect! Close to everything in the CBD with the Flinders street station only a short walk away.

We really enjoyed our stay in the apartment and would definitely come back to Sharyn's place when coming to Melbourne the next time. I can truly recommend this apartment for a convenient stay in the Melbourne CBD."

There was coffee and fresh baked bread on my first morning, along with a stocked fridge and pantry. She provided everything a person would need and more for a comfortable stay. Her apartment is absolutely gorgeous, clean, modern, and cozy.

I came for work, but in my free time Gloria and I had some excellent adventures around the city. Her home is centrally located in one of the nicest neighborhoods I saw while there. She's a block from the tram and zoo, less than a 5 minute walk to Brunswick, and right around the corner from the Monash Institute of Pharmaceutical Sciences. 

I cannot recommend staying with Gloria enough. If you need somewhere to stay and all of Melbourne I can't think of a better host or place."

The suburb is perfect, in a pleasant quiet area, just far enough out of the city to be easily accessible, but not in the middle of the noise and people.
The views are stunning and the apartment is cosy and comfortable. Gloria's son looked after me as Gloria was away, but I was made very welcome, and he even loaned me a public transport card, which overcame one of Melbourne's biggest frustrations for visitors. 
I would definitely come back to stay here in future visits to Melbourne."

I would describe her as a wonderfully welcoming, Super Duper host as she really does takes it to the next level. She has literally thought of everything... and then some! The house is beautifully decorated and furnished with gorgeous vintage furniture and everything is arranged with great finesse. It is also superbly clean and tidy. Her local knowledge is shared readily and helpful information is also in the room for your reference. She also has a range of delicious bread, condiments and teas you can enjoy for breakfast. I was so delighted by everything and this made my stay in Melbourne even more special. I will definitely stay here again. My only regret was not having more time to hang around at home (Ramona‚Äôs).

The flat is cute and in a great area. 
It is well insulated against the hot sun, yet it's sunny and had a lovely outlook. 
Everything seemed to be operational - no problems at all. 
The art and furnishings are great, and lots of interesting books to browse. The bathroom is perhaps a little more shabby chic than the rest of the flat, but a little ceiling mould was overshadowed by the overall lovely atmosphere of the entire place. 
The area is fantastic, with an abundance of shops, cafes and bars within a stone's throw.

Our room and bathroom had everything we would need during our stay - lots of towels, fresh crisp lenin, toiletries, some medicines etc. She also gave us Myki cards to use for the trams. The room and bathroom were very clean and the bed was so comfortable that we overslept. Our private bathroom/toilet was outside the room but we had full privacy.

72576,3437078,2013-01-29,4533904,Karen,0,"I really enjoyed staying at Ramona's fabulous house in Fitzroy.  The location is second-to-none, on a residential street just minutes away from Fitzroy's edgy shops, restaurants and bars.  The house is immaculate - it's stylish, fashionable and incredibly clean & comfortable.  Ramona herself is lovely.  She's very welcoming and straight away I felt at home staying in her home.

Melbourne is a super city - it's arty, quirky, fashionable and friendly.  Ramona's house is all of those things too - it's a true gem, where you get to have an authentic Melbourne experience.  I hope I get to stay there again!"
247006,21821804,2014-10-25,17797785,Karen,0,"I was pleasantly surprised with my choice of B & B.  Chris's house is in a great little quiet treed street.  Once I found my bearings I was able to enjoy a walk  through Albert Park, a short walk to cafe's, IGA, South Melbourne markets and the coast. Its close enough to the city, but far enough from the hustle and bustle.
I had a nice bright room, own bathroom, wifi, access to tv, kitchen....very comfortable and affordable.
I would highly recommend this B & B."

Judy's internet was also fast ,and it was nice to have access to a washer and dryer.  The location was great - just 2 blocks to a trolley interchange so it was easy to get anywhere in Melbourne or the surrounding areas.  Judy was a delight to talk with and very helpful.  In fact, when a family found my wallet that I had left in a taxi, Judy drove me 30 minutes out into the suburbs to retrieve it.  I highly recommend Judy's place."

Weekend late night noise is a factor to consider, The front balcony is more an access walkway for all tenants in the block. A good spring clean and a few maintenance issues would add value.

Linda did everything and some extra to make us feel at home and at the same time at a party. Many details of thoughts like lending us helmets, mykicards loaded, lots of information about what to do and see...She is a very social and friendly person and we were even invited to Christmasparty with her friends. And what a party it was!! 

Her house is amazing and it's architecture as well as all the interesting artifacts are stunning.  All facilities were very modern and fully functional. It's a very beautiful and interesting house and we also liked the neighborhood in Port Melbourne. It's close to the beach, the trams, the bikeshares and a very nice shopping/caf√©/restaurantstreet.

Her dog Boof was very friendly and absolutely well behaved.

For us this stay was superior to staying at any high end hotel. An unforgettable experience! Thank you ever so much! Please send our regards and thanks to your lovely friends too."

78143,67320549,2016-03-28,1705124,Karl,100,"Julie has an amazing house. Everything was very clean and neat. Of course the proximity to the main Chapel Street and Prahan train station was great too. For the uninitiated, this is a mere ~10 minute ride from Flinders Street Station. I drove down from Adelaide and she made sure I had a permit to park on the street. The highlight must be the comfy bed and the immaculate bathroom - a very welcome respite after a long road trip. The thoughtful scents were noted and very much appreciated. Julie has also provided spare electrical outlets right next to the bedside table for all your travel charging needs. Such attention to detail! I would highly recommend this place for anyone considering a place to stay while visiting Melbourne. "

for recomending such a wonderful and amazing host family to enjoy our stay in 
Australia. We went to Australia with so much of negative ideas and doubts, but 
these two truly amazing people were more than hosts to us.  They were our 
friends and family.  Deanna took it upon herself to help our son to find his way 
to Moorabin airport almost daily to complete his multi enigine flight training.  
In fact we went out for dinner with friends, while Deanna picked up Shehan from 
the station.  We also had a set of documents nicely compiled by her, of things 
to do and places to visit.  In fact they both took us to see houses being 
designed and constructed which is our forte.  Thank you Daryl and Deanna and 
your three wonderful kids and our little adorable four legged Charlee, for a 
truly amazing and an awesome holiday.  We will definitely come back to Australia 
for a complete holiday without flight training and studies next time and spend 
more time with you.  Hope you will have it ready for us once again. 

Cheers and God Bless all of you!

Karmini, Roshan and Shehan"

The location is perfect: a quick walk to the best restaurants, cafes, and shopping in Melbourne. Even though you‚Äôre close to everything, you won‚Äôt be kept awake by rowdy bar-goers or traffic. The street from which you enter is a dead end so virtually nobody goes down it. 
The place itself is lovely and unique and had everything I needed. It was very clean and had lots of extra towels and blankets (perfect for that unpredictable Melbourne weather). It really became a home away from home. 
Lulu and Michael were both very friendly and thoughtful. 
10/10 hope to stay here again soon "

The place was perfect for relaxing, as the house is in a safe and calm area, and I got to have my privacy when I wanted. The room was  comfortable and had much space for my baggage. Wifi worked well most of the time. The location in Newport is really good. Just about 10 minutes to train that takes you to Melbourne's center or to Williamstown beach fast and easily. "

As it was south facing we didn't need to use the air conditioning (even when it was nearly 40 degrees outside!). There's a wonderful park around the corner in addition to the gardens nearby. Despite being so close to everything, the apartment is quiet.

We had a really wonderful stay in Melbourne due to this apartment. Thank so much for having us!"

The house had everything we needed, kitchen was well stocked. I like the neighborhood better than any other part of Melbourne; quiet near the house, but bars and good Asian food nearby, and the beautiful Abbotsford Convent very close. Would love to come back!"
310594,342547338,2018-10-28,5583648,Kate,90,Bridget‚Äôs place is divine. The location in Abbotsford is a great base for exploring Melbourne and the house itself is a cosy refuge. The art and little touches about the place made my visit special - would love to return.
247006,9975084,2014-01-22,1449046,Kate,0,"Chris is an avid cyclist, and Melbourne is a great place for this pursuit, even for the novice, being reasonably flat. Melbourne has a cycle system similar to Paris: you can hire public bikes and helmets throughout the city. The first half hour is free. 
We had a lovely 3 days in his house which is an easy 10-15 minutes in the tram from the CBD, all within Zone 1 and therefore very cheap if you use the Myki card. His house is very close to two tram routes, both of which operate frequently. 
Chris was away for most of our stay, but was most welcoming at the start, providing heaps of information about ways to see Melbourne along lesser-known (read ""less touristy"") routes. He provided us with everything we needed for a gorgeous breakfast. 
We will be back!"

I felt so comfortable and wish I could have stayed longer for more stimulating conversation, first class hospitality and comfort with someone who felt more like a friend. Jack the dog and Amy the cat are equally as charming. Thank you Alan, I will certainly be back! "
215787,179609767,2017-08-08,504567,Kate,90,"I enjoyed my stay in Marilyn's apartment. It was cosy and had everything I needed. Being just around the corner from Bridge Road there are plenty of places to eat at and shops to explore in the local area. It's also a very well connected location. It is easy to jump on a tram to the city and the train station is a 10 minute walk away. 

The undercover off-street parking is tight, but was a welcome feature. 

Traffic noise is constant, but did not disturb my sleep. Overall my stay was very comfortable. Thanks so much Marilyn!"
74548,218760169,2017-12-14,7136801,Kate,97,"I'd highly recommend this spot for your stay in Melbourne. The host was fantastic - super helpful, fun and hospitable.

244952,4874742,2013-05-30,5468693,Kate,93,"Ideally sited for a city centred holiday, Rebecca's apartment is light and spacious, in a leafy setting.  The oven is excellent as are the  sharp kitchen knives which are provided.  Some porcelain dinner plates would have made serving warm food easier.  Rebecca herself is helpful and keen to resolve any issues that arise.  Overall, the apartment needs some TLC before it could really be described as ""fabulous""."
78143,69862628,2016-04-14,14653144,Kate,94,"Julie greeted us with kindness, even though it was later in the evening than expected. The bedrooms and bathroom are beautiful with all you need. Fantastic location, 5mins to Chapel Street. Quiet and safe location in secluded and secure area.

244952,20062000,2014-09-22,9173327,Kate,100,"My daughter and I loved our stay at the Treehouse. Rebecca sent us lots of info beforehand and the apartment was just as described. We loved the quiet location amongst the trees and so close to Brunswick St and several of the neighbours we met were friendly (and the cat from downstairs). We didn't use the kitchen with so many great eating places nearby but we made good use of the DVD player and couch. The bed was comfy with nice clean cotton bed linen and overall we felt really at home. The only thing I might improve is a bit more hot water in the shower. It was enough for one but I didn't check to see how quickly it reheated. Thanks Rebecca for a lovely stay, we will be back. "
80986,449038184,2019-05-06,113001553,Kate,100,"Perfect location to city and restaurants. Everything you need for a weekend getaway. Frank and Vince were great hosts who provided  prompt, detained information. Will definitely stay here again."
72576,1377991,2012-05-29,2416994,Kate,100,"Perfect spot for us as we were looking for something in Fitzroy near cozy pubs, shopping and walking distance to The Tote. It was a block from trams and close to dozens of crowded restaurants and bars. Ramona was fantastic with her dining recs and we had the best brekky on the planet.  The house is incredibly modern and has a minimalist, artsy vibe with a lot of natural light and clean as a whistle. Ramona has gourmet bread for her guests and tea available anytime. If you want to stay in there's an ipod jack in the rooms plus a dvd library as well. She has every Nick Cave album. A good sign."

It's right in the middle of Fitzroy, so close to great bars and independent shops and restaurants, but it's also a quiet little haven of a flat. We loved the feeling of being up in the trees, surrounded by green and hearing the birds in the morning. The flat is really light and lovely, and Rebecca is open, friendly, and easy to communicate with. Highly recommended. "
244952,187916100,2017-08-28,5674391,Kate,96,Rebecca's place was exactly as described and was in a fantastic location. Would definitely stay here again and recommend that others do too!

From the delicious selection of breads and muffins in the morning, to the gorgeous little gift on arrival and thoughtfully decorated rooms, Ramona ensured that my stay was as comfortable as possible.  It felt like a relaxing home, and made my stay in Melbourne a memorable one.

100% recommended!"

47100,49459885,2015-10-04,1860962,Kate,95,"We felt welcome in Loren's house from the moment we entered.   I'm not kidding when I say it felt like we were visiting an old friend's place; familiar and warm.  Loren was always a message away with encouraging advice that made me feel so happy to know she was in some way a part of this trip.  I feel like we had a true Melbourne experience, hiring bikes, attending the local Yoga studio and scoring tickets to the MCG.  The Italian deli down the road is a must and you are a short bike ride from anywhere you need to see whilst in Melbourne. Loren's place wins!!!!"
47100,619341,2011-10-11,973435,Kate,96,We loved our stay in Richmond. Loren and Ruth were wonderful hosts with lots of good ideas about things we could do in town. They have a lovely house and it's close to great bakeries and cute stores... and just a quick tram ride from downtown.

241263,228698235,2018-01-21,74428965,Kate,98,"Where to start in writing a review for Gloria's home...! 
Gloria was very responsive to all of our messages from the moment we booked and when we had some unforeseen travel issues which she immediately helped us out with and put herself to enormous trouble to do so. 
The apartment is in a beautiful location, opposite a huge park (ideal for running and working out) and is just a short tram ride from the centre of Melbourne. It's beautifully furnished and the space is large - a good sized bedroom and bathroom with a huge walk in shower, beautiful bed linen, toiletries, hairdryer... everything you could possibly want for a comfortable stay.
We were invited to help ourselves to her wide range of herbal teas, fresh coffee, juice, water and fruit and there was a lovely selection of healthy breakfast items (yogurt, good bread and jams, stewed fruit).
It is also ridiculously good value considering its proximity to Melbourne City Centre and the exceptionally high standard of accommodation. 
And then there is Gloria! I feel as though we have made a new friend for life. She is funny, interesting, warm, incredibly hospitable and welcoming. Nothing was too much trouble and it was a real pleasure to stay in her beautiful home. 
I cannot recommend this place highly enough! Thank you Gloria :)"
227028,5560956,2013-07-06,6592285,Kate,100,"Wonderful winter stay in Dan's apartment in Melbourne.

307630,3637902,2013-02-26,5112807,Kath,93,"Location is great being so central.  Host Sharyn is also very friendly and welcoming.  Noise from construction site (even on the weekends) is too much.  Property itself is very tired and smelly due to cigarette smoke.  Room itself was clean enough as was the bathroom. As this is a rented property carpets are heavily stained and paint old and stained in places.  We appreciate this is not a hotel but didnt think the standard of accommodation fitted the price.  I was shocked at the standard as all the reviews read well.  Perhaps I am just way too fussy! I dont think so however as I live in a ""bush house"" in Queensland. My star rating is 1 for location and 1 for Sharyn.  "
43429,2529702,2012-10-07,3354992,Kath,84,Loved this cosy tranquil studio accommodation. It was just perfect for our 3 day stay in suburban Melbourne. Our hosts were most hospitable and any request was never any trouble. Easy public transport to the city and yet quiet enough to relax and enjoy the garden.
241263,3104126,2012-12-17,2735578,Katharina,99,Great host and great location. We had a wonderful stay with Gloria and enjoyed her mediterranean-infused hospitality. Thanks for sharing your valuable insider knowledge on Melbourne and surroundings.

It was great."
75109,24328574,2014-12-26,22506115,Katharina,94,We really enjoyed our first experience with Airbnb. Karen and Jim were really good hosts who took great care of us. Getting to celebrate Christmas with their lovely family was a pleasure. We'd definitely stay with them again in the future if we were around.
241263,25955239,2015-01-31,7869645,Katharina,92,"What a perfect time at Gloria's home! Gloria is the perfect hostess - caring, warm and always there for her guests with good advice and a helping hand. Everything was perfectly organized and she did everything to make our stay as comfortable and pleasant as it could be. Apart from that the cosy appartment is a 10 minutes ride with the tram away from the city, located in a beautiful green and quiet area with parks around. Everything was tasteful, very clean and cosy. We can definitely recommend it to anyone who wants to have a perfect time and a place to feel at home in Melbourne! "
38271,410234100,2019-02-10,59281140,Katharine,100,Very clean with every detail considered!

72576,12627014,2014-05-06,5688260,Katherine,89,"I stayed with Ramona for 5 nights as I was visiting my children who had recently located to Melbourne from Perth. Also it was my birthday!
The accommodation was exactly as stated on the website and I was pleased to find that it was clean and comfortable with all my needs met. The miki card was very convenient as was all the other maps and guides located in the study area. The location in Fitzroy was exactly what I was looking for: nearby cafes and bars, the tram stop at the end of the street, and when energetic, a 30 minute walk into the CBD.
As I was out and about with the children most of the time, I hardly saw Ramona, and her tasty breads and muffins on offer were overlooked, however, everything was there if needed.
The time went too quickly and hopefully it won't be too long before I return.

He is so considerate and humorous. I really have a great time with him in Melbourne. He was ill at that time, but he still showed me around. I love the days I spent with him and the meals he cooked (including the Vegemite, of course:) ). 
The cottage is a historical building with many treasures in it, such as books, photos, paintings...and there‚Äôre many beautiful roses in the garden. They are my favorite!
Jack and Amy are very clever and friendly. You‚Äôll be glad to meet them."
230790,429748023,2019-03-29,239915933,Katherine,97,Spacious home with all amenities. Lovely and clean and the host was fantastic with check-in and any other questions we had.

67211,39068595,2015-07-20,13109806,Katherine-Anne,63,"Kate was a wonderful host, and was particularly accommodating given my flight landed very late and she was awake to let me in and then, later in my stay, I locked myself out (twice!)!  It was a pleasure to meet Kate and I think that anyone who stays here is very fortunate.

The apartment is lovely and cosy, with plenty of heating (it was cold in Melbourne when I visited).  Everything was very clean and easy to find your way around.    It is also very conveniently located to public transport to the city, and the lovely cafes around Kew. 

I had a great time - thanks Kate!"

244952,18736115,2014-08-31,6125615,Kathie,0,"I stayed in the Treehouse Apartment in August and unsually for Melbourne winter it was sunny and spring like. The sun streamed in the windows in the afternoon making it warm and very relaxing. A large camellia was in flower opposite the window, very nice. Great spot for one, pretty good for a close couple but I wouldn't try and squeeze 3 there.

Great location, this area, city end of Brunswick St, Fitzroy has easy access to everything you need and great cafes, shopping etc. Really good tram services both from Nicholson St (thru to St Kilda) and Brunswick St.

Kitchen facilities, cooking gear, crockery etc basic but you'll probably be out for most meals.
Rebecca was away but everything was organised for arrival and her cleaner was easily available by SMS when I had a query."
51592,10059663,2014-01-28,9360340,Kathie,96,"This central Warehouse Apartment has a great location and in easy walking distance to most everything. Very spacious apartment with a unique feel. We found it rather quiet considering it was in the heart of the city. Great places to breakfast around the corner in Hardware Lane, Alfagato does a great breakfast with good service. The apartment itself probably needs a little maintenance eg. Timber in kitchen is looking a bit shabby and the wire on steps and rails needs tensioning. The artwork around the apartment is great and of course the swing in the middle of the lounge is different! Loved hearing the town clock strike from 7am and during the day. We felt that maybe it was slightly overpriced for the quality of the apartment's finishing. But overall we enjoyed staying there and felt very safe. We found the apartment comfortable and intriguing but maybe only 3 star in quality."
47100,4026106,2013-04-03,5508531,Kathleen,96,An absolute dream.  These two ladies will make you feel at home in an instant.  Don't even look at other places in Richmond - this location is unparalleled and the company is perfection - we loved our visit with you two!
76867,132938372,2017-02-19,44681804,Kathleen,98,Judy's place was very easy to get to and she gave very clear instructions prior to arrival.

The bathroom has a great shower, luxurious towels and a choice of toiletries. The welcome pack is comprehensive and packed with useful information.

I would recommend her  rooms to all and I will certainly be there next time i am in Melbourne.  Thank You Angel

I can highly recommend it:-) you will love it"
263871,3457652,2013-02-02,3865369,Kathryn,98,"Eliisa has a lovely flat in a fanastically central part of a wonderful city and was a great host. I spent about four weeks here in January 2013 when I had just moved to Melbourne and it was a fantastic base. The place is just as it looks and the living room is nice and roomy. Eliisa is based overseas but her parents were around to give me the keys, and were extrememly kind and helpful. Given the central location, you may be wondering about whether the area is noisy. There can be some noise on weekend evenings, but overall it's not a noisy part of town and it's not close to any night spots or that kind of thing. "

150729,685662,2011-11-01,774519,Kathryn,98,"I stayed with Ramona for four weeks whilst working in Melbourne and it was fantastic.  I'd reiterate everything that all the other reviewers say - Ramona is a lovely woman, who couldn't be more helpful, welcoming and friendly.  The house is exactly as it appears on the photos - stylish, clean, but with a friendly atmosphere (created by Ramona).  The location is perfect - right in the heart of Fitzroy which has great shops, cafes, pubs and galleries and only 20 mins walk from the city (if that), and well connected by tram.  Ramona puts in a huge amount of effort to make you feel at home and little touches - like having umbrellas for guests to use - are really thoughtful.  When I'm back in Melbourne I will definitely stay there again. I can't recommend little george st enough!"

It was great to come 'home' each day to such a comfortable modern, spacious area that was so beautifully furnished.
We also made the most of the secluded sun filled back yard finding this area very relaxing.  Raewyn was so hospitable ... with her home-made bread & fruit salad, well stocked pantry & fridge.

Ramona is a wonderful host- friendly, really helpful, and respectful of privacy. The house is amazing- light, spacious, really clean, and Ramona adds lovely touches (like flowers in the room). The location is great too- so many cafes and restaurants nearby and only 20 min walk to uni of Melbourne and the cbd. I would recommend staying with Ramona at little George unreservedly. "

We didn't need to go out for any supplies as coffee, tea, milk, bread, condiments and cereal were all provided .. such a nice change from motel/hotel accommodation.  I am sure it is one of the better accommodation choices in the area.  "

My room was spic-and-span and it had Melbourne paraphernalia available too! :) Mario was sooo easy to hang out with. He introduced me to his favorite show (which was hilarious and awesome), was very accommodating even when I got sick, and just made the entire stay extremely easy. He even remembered my 2 nieces (which I told him briefly) and gave me some gifts for them - really awesome guy! Highly recommend his place to anyone visiting Melbourne! "

So nice to stay somewhere that felt like home for the week whilst training & being so busy & I loved having a dog to pat! Felt much safer & more at ease staying here as I was travelling on my own. Cheers & thanks Sharyn! I owe you a bottle of bubbles! 
76867,5970653,2013-07-24,6532871,Katie,97,"Absolutely loved the time we spent with Judy, drinking wine and discussing TV shows and movies. The apartment is brilliant, right up on the top floor of the building, really nice view of South Melbourne, the room itself was just like home, and the building is about 500m from a tram stop, taking you anywhere you want in Melbourne.

I would not hesitate to book with Judy again if we're in need for accomodation in Melbourne."
10803,19417039,2014-09-12,3242826,Katie,95,All good. I loved looking at all your stuff and perusing your books.  
72576,120485103,2016-12-10,103406045,Katie,99,"Amazing house, location, and host! Ramona made us feel very comfortable and happy in her home. She is full of tips and suggestions of places to hang out/eat in Fitzroy which was incredibly helpful for us (especially as vegans!). The bed is super comfy, bread and tea selection is to die for, the whole house is just lovely! We were only a few minutes walk away from the wonderful main streets in Fitzroy and a 10 minute bike ride from town. We had the best time at Little George and fell in love with Fitzroy and it's incredible vegan food, so we'll definitely be back! "
268849,113799381,2016-11-13,18612063,Katie,98,Apart an issue with no key on arrival which Mia was able to solve it was a wonderful stay. Fabulous location and the apartment is beautiful.  It is chic and tasteful -a great inner city stay. Thanks Mia

Such a convenient place for the tram to get to the city.

150729,462145693,2019-06-02,6159659,Katie,100,"I loved Ramona's place! Not only is her home amazing but she's thought of everything you could possibly need and more. Checking in was a breeze even though I was arriving late at night and Ramona was very quick to respond to any queries I had. I also really appreciated her extensive list of recommendations for Fitzroy and the wider Melbourne area. The location is super close to transport and great cafes/restaurants but still nice and quiet, and the room was super comfortable and cosy. I was a little worried about the cold (I don't deal well with Melbourne weather!) but there was plenty of blankets as well as the reverse cycle aircon - I needn't have worried anyway as the room temp was quite pleasant. I'll definitely be back!"
74548,16088426,2014-07-22,10687444,Katie,0,"Mario's listing is spot on and so are the multitude of positive reviews posted for his accommodation.  Everything was really great. 

I was in Melbourne for a busy weekend of catching up with various friends who were also visiting the city so I was out and about for most the time. Mario is such a lovely welcoming host I did wish I had time to hang out with him a little more. 
He really has thought of everything to make guests stays as comfortable and easy as possible.  

And the comfy bed: Best ever! I slept so so well that I took note of the mattress brand and model before I left because I now want to replace my own!"
51592,174123085,2017-07-25,3901168,Katie,99,"Michelle was a great host, very accommodating and communicative. Upon finding out we're both vegetarian, she recommended vegetarian restaurants and went out of her way to make sure we were comfortable. Michelle's place was beautiful, spacious and very central & easy to get to. Would definitely recommend staying here!"
161033,31879895,2015-05-11,4134727,Katie,0,"My partner and I enjoyed a lovely cozy evening at the cottage. It had everything we could need for a night away. 
We where not disappointed in the morning, about 10 kangaroo's grazing on the lawn for hours. We opened the curtains and watched them and thought how amazing is this. 
The host Karen was lovely and gave us everything we needed.
I would pick this accommodation over a motel anyday. "
307630,3965203,2013-03-31,1496265,Katie,96,"Sharyn was a delighful host - friendly and bubbly! She was helpful in offering local tips, umbrellas for every outfit, and even handy with the iron. The location is very central. Roger is awesome too. Would (and have already) recommended to friends for their trip down. Cheers a million!"

157427,235757744,2018-02-17,172249527,Katie,90,"This place is great for the soul. I had been feeling very agitated about noise from Melbourne city apartment living, so having quiet and peaceful accommodation was very important. All you can hear in this place is the sound of birds and leaves rustling. The gardens are an absolute delight as are the hosts. 
The pillows are soft and comfortable and the place is immaculately clean. The continental breakfast included cereals, multigrain and fruit toast, butter, honey, ham, Vegemite, peanut butter, coffee, a variety of teas, milk, orange juice, yogurt and what I guess to be homemade jar of preserved fruit. 
There‚Äôs a cute little dog and a cat on the property too. Will definitely stay again."

72576,150911375,2017-05-10,103406045,Katie,94,"This was our second time staying with the lovely Ramona. She is so warm and hospitable, more of a friend than a host, always making everything as easy as possible and going out of her way to make sure everyone has the best time. Ramona has great local knowledge, if you follow her advice you won't go astray. She fosters a communal environment in her home which makes all guests feel very comfortable. Thanks Ramona! We can't wait to come back x "
244952,74532403,2016-05-15,47793532,Katie,93,We loved our stay at Rebecca's cosy apartment. It's in a perfect location to enjoy the city and the relaxed vibe of Fitzroy and surrounds. Trams at both ends of the street or a quick walk to heaps of shops and cafes in either direction. The apartment had everything we needed and Rebecca was really helpful and accommodating. Will be recommending to friends and family.

120487,23684055,2014-12-08,22310433,Katrina,0,"Barbara was a delightful host and went out of her way to ensure my stay was comfortable, private and quiet. The Garden Bungalow was homely and met my needs for my extended stay as I was attending a work course at nearby Cheltenham (a 10 minute drive). The local Parkdale shops and cafes are only a 5 minute walk and the beach an easy ten minute walk.  I would definitely stay again in future and would recommend Barbara's accommodation to anyone. My only recommendation to Barbara was the need for a desk for study purposes which she is considering."
241263,27910183,2015-03-14,1329947,Katrina,90,"Gloria was a delight to stay with. She was communicative and more than generous from the start. I booked a single night just a couple of days prior to arrival, and Gloria was warm and accommodating. The room was clean and fresh, and I was offered a cup of tea and conversation within 5 minutes of arriving. Gloria is an interesting and kind woman, and I would highly recommend staying with her if you are an independent traveller looking for quiet and clean accommodation with an affectionate cat and fantastic host.

The house is ideally situated in a quiet cul de sac in Armadale. The public transport system which includes buses, trams and trains are all close by and within easy walking distance. I had a nice big room with a comfortable single bed, plenty of cupboard space, a desk, bookshelves filled with interesting books and sofa. Internet was available to me at extra cost of AU$ 10 per week. Although I always had my meals out the kitchen facilities were there for to me for use as well as laundry and ironing. I stayed a month and enjoyed every minute of it "

I loved the apartment, which felt secure and light. A top place and Danielle was really helpful as well. Highly recommended."
257149,13932254,2014-06-08,5728232,Keith,96,"We were in Melbourne to visit our son who lives nearby, and Lanie's apartment was perfect in terms of location.  But what we discovered was that it was also very close to a multitude of wonderful shops and cafe's in the High St, a short walk from the station for our trip into the city, and an equally short walk to the trams.  Lanie was an excellent host, communicating throughout, providing us with myki cards (a pain to get hold of!) and a very welcome care package of milk, bread etc on arrival! The flat is very clean, comfortable and warm, well provisioned and quiet.  I'd certainly recommend Lanie's apartment to any prospective tenants.."
150729,367886431,2019-01-05,119385166,Kelley,100,Incredible neighborhood and a very stylish and comfortable space. Ramona went out of her way to make sure that I was comfortable and happy. Highly recommended.
313648,3031989,2012-12-05,1711232,Kellie,96,"Haydn and Katrina are great hosts.  They were actually away for our arrival date but made sure their parents were there to greet us and to give us a run down of the apartment.  The apartment is just perfect, impeccably neat and tidy with everything you need.  Location couldnt be better, we walked into the city, Richmond and Fitzroy, taxi was only $10 when little legs couldnt walk anymore and trams are local too.  The apartment is perfect for a single, couple of small family - we stayed with our 5 year old and there was plenty of room for a fold up in the bedroom or we could just use the comfortable sofa in the living area.  Friends who came to visit were so impressed also - they are recommending to their business travellers.  Thank you Haydn and Katrina for your hospitality and arranging our left items to be returned.  Kindest Regards and see you next time.  Kellie, Stu & Liam"

161033,15372554,2014-07-07,6008662,Kelly,85,"Karen was really welcoming and helped us get settled in this lovely little cabin in Chum Creek. When we arrived the heater was on and it was toasty warm which was lovely given it was a chilly winter weekend. The cabin is cosy, and had so many little details that made our stay a lovely one. We appreciated the handmade jams & fairtrade tea (thanks, yum)! We liked waking up and seeing the kangaroos outside the window in the morning, that was fun. A good location, a little out of Healesville, so it's nice and quiet, but still very easy to get to restaurants and great little shops. We liked it!"
268849,27540130,2015-03-07,8646835,Kelly,87,"Mia made me feel very welcomed to her home and the area (indeed, I even bumped into her and her boyfriend at one of her dinner recommendations!). Mia was very responsive and friendly throughout the experience and was very easy to work with.

Her previous guest checked out late, but Mia personally cleaned the flat to ensure it was ready soon after I arrived. Even though I was slightly delayed in arriving, Mia ensured it was no problem.

South Yarra is one of my favourite areas in Melbourne. The flat is very secure and in a great location for exploring the surrounding area with plenty of food and shopping options to discover! The bed was extremely comfortable - great after a busy day out and about.

It wasn't a problem for me, but just to note for those who may be jet lagged / like to sleep in: there are 2 new apartment blocks being constructed nearby, so it is a bit noisy after 7am M-F.

I look forward to seeing Mia next time I am in South Yarra - or she is in Perth!"

Can improve: 1) sound proofing from outside 2) creaky floorboards! 3) ventilation could be improved; 4) slippery (somewhat dangerous) shower floor.  Hoang has indicated that it was shoddy work by the developer so she's in process of fixing it. Kudos to her! :)"
72576,3417118,2013-01-26,4704213,Kelly,100,"Ramona's apartment was my first experience of air bnb and now I'm hooked!

Ramona's place really is spectacular and exactly like the photo's. The upstairs bedroom is completely self contained so I actually felt like I had the whole apartment to myself. Excellently situated in whats my opinion the best part of Melbourne with lots of great cafes, bars and restaurants within five minutes walking distance. And the host was perfect, always near by if you needed anything but left you to your own devices to explore this great city.

Next time i'm in Melbourne I'll definitely be stopping at Ramona's, it beats the relatives couches hands down!"
108032,109667604,2016-10-22,8131199,Kelly,98,"The location of this studio is perfect. Couldn't have been more central to the trams and all the shopping and great restaurants. The bed and linens were very comfortable. Malcolm was very accommodating with check in and he left a bottle of wine and some snacks for us! Check out couldnt have been simpler.  There were lots of bathroom towels and a bathroom shelving unit to place toiletries. I was able to move some linens in the closet to make enough space for my clothes. The door to the building is via an alley/lane, but you can still hear some noise from the street at night when the windows are open. It wasnt too bad though.  Overall, this place was great and we would definitely recommend it.  Thanks Malcolm!!!!"

We ended up watching a movie of hers, and the TV and sound system were quite nice.  As we were there in the winter, it was quite cold in the apartment.  There was a space heater in the bedroom, which was great, but the rest of the house was freezing.  Overall a good experience!"

Her house's location is very good! It is within the Melbourne CBD and within the free tram zone. What makes her place special is that it is very quiet and you can barely hear any car noises, very atypical in Melbourne CBD. 

If your looking for a peaceful and quiet place to stay in Melbourne CBD, Sharyn's home is the best for you. "

We had no problem finding it and actually very much enjoyed the area and stalking the Kangaroos (a group of at least 25) to try to get close to them was one of the highlights of our entire trip.   The cabin is small, but private and had everything we could have wanted for our 3 days and 2 nights stay.   Karen was helpful and pleasant.   We would recommend her place and hoe to stay there again sometime in the future. "

Vicki is a fantastic host. She introduced local festivals to us and gave us a ride along the Frankston's Waterfront.

With her help and advice, we were able to enjoy our journey very much and had a remarkable experience! 
I will choose to revisit and stay at her house in the future.

The historic and one of the very earliest areas of Melbourne is diverse, vibey, bohemian, interesting but genteel as the same time.  One can easily walk to the Melbourne Museum and Botanical Gardens and then into the city or take the trams which are all over the place and minutes to get to. Romona's home is a little bit vintage, a little bit industrial, a whole lot of stylish in a very contemporary light filled building. Exceptionally comfortable and well equipped."

From our initial meeting at Ganache, through the introduction to the Apartment, the welcoming bottle of wine and fresh fruit , the check in was seamless.

The Apartment was exactly as pictured and the use of space and facilities on hand is quite amazing. A large bathroom was also a big plus.

Then - the location - absolutely faultless - shopping to the right of me - food and drink to the left here I am stuck in the middle:)

Look forward to coming back some time soon.

She had no problem accommodating our late-night arrival and graciously let us wash our laundry which was a life saver! The bedroom, bathroom and kitchen have all you would need plus added charm from Ramona's vintage collections.  My girlfriend loved talking to her about her amazing finds and curations! These collections give her home a unique, relaxed feeling that we enjoyed. 

The neighborhood itself is packed with vintage stores, coffee shops and restaurants. You could easily spend several days just exploring Fitzroy. Ramona laid out neighborhood guidebooks and told us about some of her favorite cafes (which of course we tried and loved). At night the area is lively although take care on Brunswick St. as there is a block of public housing and we did encounter one angry gentleman but we are from NYC and are used to characters  :) 

If we ever make it back to Melbourne we would certainly love to stay with Ramona again! Everything you could want in a host and home. Thank you!

You have access to everything a traveler needs: a nice, spacious room, a washing machine, breakfast, internet and even a bookshelf with a range of exciting books. If you are lucky, as I was, you may be invited to a delicious homely dinner with a bunch of other lovely guys. And if you feel that you have a problem with the new town, Loretta is always helpful.

241263,333138215,2018-10-07,99994687,Kian Howe,97,"I visited Melbourne to attend a conference at the University of Melbourne. I had the great pleasure of staying at Gloria‚Äôs. The apartment is stunning and the room has a luxurious feel. The bed is comfortable and the interior of the room is sleek, coupled with a private bathroom and a balcony. This is a truly posh, easy to get to (via tram) and homely stay. 

Gloria is not only a professional host but a warm and intelligent person. I get on really well with Gloria ‚Äì she is generous with her time and knowledge. Such Airbnb experience is unique as it connects people and embraces diversity. 

Finally, I am writing this review from the stunning view of this house overlooking the green and leafy view of Parkville, the Dandenong, the Victorian terraces and the city. It‚Äôs a lovely part of the city having lived here previously for one year. 

I would recommend Gloria‚Äôs place for business travellers and holiday makers."

Judy made us feel so at home.  We shared a few glasses of wine and got excellent directions and help in order to get our Melbourne bearings. And the small things two...she had two MIKI cards for us to use, how thoughtful is that.

I didn't see Lindsay much (only briefly when I arrived) and didn't have a chance to say good-bye. I really liked the yoga studio downstairs and enjoyed a lovely class there. The room is clean and tidy. The rest of the apartment is not very tidy, there are stuff everywhere. Can't say the kitchen was very clean. The location suited me perfectly for my purpose to coming to Melbourne. There's a few nice place to eat very close to Lindsay's place. About the noise? Well I would guess that during the week the neighbourhood is relatively quiet, but I came on a week-end and the pub opposite was very noisy. I did enjoy my time there as it worked well for me, just needed a room to stay in. Thank you Lindsay :) Nandini"

74548,60379323,2016-01-23,41950070,Kim,93,"Mario instantly made me feel welcome with his friendly and relaxed attitude, so much so that i truly felt at home in his place for the duration of my stay. 
All the facilities provided were clean and comfortable, it was good having access onsite to gym, sauna, spa and pool. The neighbourhood was perfect for my requirements, everything within walking distance.
However, the standout feature of the entire experience was Mario's remarkable intuitive ability to successfully establish a genuine friendship with a stranger while respecting boundaries of personal space, giving generously of himself while doing so. He was interesting and funny, and took time to show me some things I didn't know about Melbourne.
Staying with Mario was definitely a far better experience for me than staying in a hotel."

The location is really good, near to so many tram services, Queen Victoria Market, not far from the Lygon street with so many choices of quality food(quoting Mario!). Mario is an awesome host, he is always approachable (just an sms away) and offered me daily travel advice according to my need, and he is also a very humorous guy! Thanks to his suggestions, my Melbourne trip was so much enriched! Prior to the trip, I was too preoccupied to plan much, but Melbourne is really easy, and Go West tours(highly recommended too) actually picked me up from and dropped me off the door! I sure would recommend this to any solo traveller! Great location, awesome host and lovely apartment!"

The bed was comfortable, the garden quiet and of course there was an air con!!  We were close to our family which was the intention of the stay. 
Barbara and Henry are terrific, friendly and warm guests. Highly recommended."

I was in Melbourne with my daughter aged 4 and my sister for a festival and this apartment was a real treat, with a washing machine, full kitchen and all the utensils necessary to create a home away from home. The apartment is stylish with a lovely vibe and very spacious. It's within walking distance to shops, cafes and the tram. Hoang and her family made us feel very much at home. Their generous and open energy was greatly appreciated. I would highly recommend staying here. Many thanks to Hoang and family!

Alan is a true gentleman, a warm and welcoming host and a wonderful cook. He is so kind and thoughtful and considerate of others needs and privacy. I only wish I could sit across from the dinner table and talk to him every night...he is one of the most interesting men I have ever met and definitely from a time of grace and elegance and he has wonderful manners. His home is real and full of love, as are his pets, Jack and Amy. Alan house is a home in the best possible sense of the word and one that I feel very privliged to have shared in my three days in ""Magical Melbourne"". I can not wait until my next trip to Melbourne and to stay with Alan again. I feel so comfortable that I'd even suggest my 20yr old daughter stays there as I know she will be safe and well looked after. Thank you so much Air BnB but more importantly, thank you Alan, you are a treasure!"

Unfortunately I didn't have time to pop in and take a peak (Although I had intentions of checking out the space) but they said it was very true to the pictures!! I believe they may have taken some ideas for their own project currently being built. Thanks for being such an accommodating host.

Neil was friendly and offered us a lot of information about Melbourne - came in very handy for a couple of Brisbane girls.  Would definitely stay there again.

Thanks for everything Neil!!

The one thing you may not get a sense of until you get there is the awesomeness of its location, which is basically perfect for everything (especially if you are a Brunswick St fan!). We were able to walk to almost all of the locations on our must see/do /eat list and a quick tram ride to things slightly further afield. Light filled and airy due to the super cute balcony, which was perfect to sit out on any time of day. Rebecca is lovely, with fantastic communication. Book now and start getting excited about your stay! We managed to fit so much into our 3 days because our accommodation was so perfect and fantastically located. Thank you Rebecca."

A few doors down is a little strip of cafes, restaurants and take always. Miss Alex & Co (cafe) was absolutely superb coffee/food/service. The hosts (Frank & Vince) were so easy to get hold of and friendly. The location suited us perfectly- we had a hire car but also walked (10-15 mins) to Elwood Beach, Acland St, supermarket, Botanical Gardens etc. I can't fault this place- we have stayed in several places around this area now and wouldn't stay anywhere else now we know about this gem!

From the fact that you have a 18th-floor view of the beautiful city of Melbourne, to the fact that you can walk to anywhere you'd like from the apartment, this place has no negatives in sight. I enjoyed waking up at this place every morning; I had a very private room, that amazingly came with a private bathroom. The 7th floor had a fully stocked gym, sauna, swimming pool, bbq area, and tennis court. You couldn't ask for more as a city dweller. There is a stocked grocery store downstairs and more variety of food than you could ever ask for within 5 minutes walking distance. I could go on and on, but Mario's place is a steal for the price and value of your trip. Thanks Mario!"

The apartment lived up to advanced billing, clean comfortable and well appointed with a hip vibe.  Speaking of hip, or rather hipster, the apartment is at the epicenter of Melbourne's hipster scene.  It is eclectic and cool.  Heaps of great coffee and food options.  It is not too hip to have a 7-11 and groceries though, a big plus.  All of this is a block, maybe two from Hoang's flat.  Close to the CBD, when we wanted it.  Great to experience another part of the city.  We loved it. "

72576,127387536,2017-01-17,1139779,Kirsty,87,"Oh gosh what I can say! Ramona's place is an absolute gem! So spacious (split over 3 floors) and with such unique details, such as the floor to ceiling Antony & the Johnsons mural on the wall, piles of old books, rustic furniture and huge outdoor space (over two balconies!). The room I had was the whole top floor, so bedroom, own bathroom and little mezzanine. The bathroom was spacious and water pressure was good in the shower. The bed was super comfy and the AC was greatly appreciated on the day it was 38 degrees! Even though there were other guests staying in the rooms on the ground floor, I never heard them in the morning in the kitchen area, as the upstairs bedroom is quite separated and peaceful. And finally, Ramona: the perfect host! Cheerful, chatty, and welcoming.  It really felt like I was staying with an old friend. The bread and spreads she leaves out for guests are delicious and the perfect way to start the day. Overall a 10 out of 10, and I would stay here again in a heartbeat when I'm next in Melbourne!"
150729,12284066,2014-04-28,7375647,Kit,94,"I had an absolutely brilliant time at Ramona's beautiful house in Fitzroy. It is ideally positioned for all of the best cafes and bars - Gertrude Street in particular has a lovely feel to it, with so many independent shops and very pretty streets leading off on both sides.

Ramona's house was a pleasure to hang out in and her thoughtful touches made it feel like a home from home. The room was a great size, was very comfortable, had lots of storage and very usefully, a desk. I would absolutely recommend staying with Ramona, as not only is she very accommodating, she is also a very charming and informative host!"

74715,28159943,2015-03-19,25176306,Klaudia,100,"A warm and welcoming hostfamily was waiting for us and it is due to them that we are now in love with Australia.  It was a place that felt like home from the moment we stepped through the door for the first time. Walter and his family made us feel part of that loving, helpful and fun family. 
The house was very clean, the room had a comfy bed with a large mattress and a great view into the lovely veggie garden with the yummiest tomatoes on earth! We were welcome to use the whole house, could cook and come and go as we pleased and Walter even served breakfast every morning with organic cereal and bread!
Great for kids too as Walter has a little son. My 6 year old daughter was allowed to use all the toys (incl. dog) and play in the garden and backyard. 
The time flew by way too fast! Thank you Walter, Amanda and Jimmy for the great time we had,
Klaudia and Ava"

It was an experience to meet her that I won't forget. And her place was just supreme. Located in the best place possible on Melbourne, within walking distance of lots of cafes, shops, parks, and trams and trains. And just such a nice and unique house to live in, very practical, nice artwork around, and everything you need is there, I really loved to be there.

Its for the warm welcome making you feel absolutely at home with the run of her house which is well organised and very homely. The room itself is cozy and with your own large toilets yes two one for shower and wash and smaller WC great soft towels and beautiful linen. The kitchen is well stocked and tea and coffee is available 24 hours for you to make. She welcomes you with a glass of wine when she is home and that really sets the tone for conversations. Her having a MYKI card (Melbourne Transport Card - a must!) for you to top and use as you go saves you the 6$ you would have to pay . Great views of the sea and ships some good restaurants around on Park Street. A good heated pool to exercise is the other plus tho there is a tennis court but it was too cold for that! Close to Domain Interchange for easy trams access. My tram to work ran from across the entrance ....totally wow! Hope to be back soon Judy keep up the great experience!"

The stay was superb value for money, with all amenities working properly except the wifi connectivity; The range of the network was blocked by the old thick walls, so there isn't any connection from the bedroom. This was of particular issue to me, since I work from my computer full time, but those who seek a vacation to disconnect could be perfectly alright with this.

Water pressure was good, plenty of space to sit and relax with a book, and the spacious bedroom would be ideal for couples. Location was right next to a supermarket and to Carlisle street, so lots of options for food. 

Chung regularly cleaned my room from top to bottom once a week; he keeps a spotless house. 

All around a great experience, just with a very inconvenient issue for me specifically due to my telecommuting job, and the poor wifi signal from the bedroom."

It has been impeccably decorated and is spotlessly clean, and so so spacious! We spent a long warm afternoon on the wonderful balcony (which is covered in turf, and faces some beautiful gum trees).

Kate was so kind and flexible, and really went out of her way to help us in our stay. The surrounds are very quiet at night and the bed is big and comfy, so we were able to sleep really well here. And the location! Right on Brunswick Street and Smith Streets, walking distance into the city, right next door to the Carlton Gardens, and next to more cafes and restaurants than we could get to in 2 weeks, let along two days.

I cannot recommend this apartment highly enough for anyone wanting to stay in the best area in Melbourne. I'm a Melbourne local (but live in the outer suburbs) and our stay here was just wonderful in every way."

Judy is such a bundle of joy and energy and went well above expectations - even taking me personally to check out The Block site.  Much more like staying with a good friend - sharing stories over wine and dinner.  She was also very aware of personal space and not to be too intrusive if I needed some quiet time also.  Apartment is in an amazing location and great views.  I highly recommend anyone looking to stay in South Melbourne to stay here.

The construction work outside was not too bad ! 

The dog was friendly! As was sharyn.

My husband & I stayed for a week in January. The accommodation was lovely & very clean. I was surprised to find that is was well equipt in the kitchen area and had lots of treats. So no need to immediately go to the supermarket  (welcome beers = fantastic). Lots of space & privacy, comfortable bed, split system air-conditioning/heating, great TV, excellent free wifi connection, good shower pressure & a lovely peaceful yard to relax in. 

The neighborhood is safe and quiet. It is an easy 3 minute walk to the local train station, restaurants & a small supermarket. Plenty of free parking on the street. Approximately 8-10 minute walk to a lovely beach. 

Henry was also a fantastically well behaved Labrador. I really wanted to take Henry with me. YES, we also saw some gorgeous possums :) 

We visited during a long heatwave in Melbourne reaching the mid 40's and I can easily say that the air-conditioner worked very well for us.

We could not have asked for anything more. I personally did not want to leave & would love to come back for a visit. We would recommend Barbara and her 'Garden Bungalow with the possums', with top votes.

Thank-you Barbara & Henry

Very quick to also reply back to queries of any nature.The place was lovely and stylish and quaint for 2 people to stay. The place is very conveniently located near Chapel st, trams and the metro. It's a great area to go shopping and all kind of food. Breakfast at the cafe below was surprisingly impeccable and a great way to start your mornings. Some other pros of staying here were the secure car spot Mia made available, which is great if you want to hire a car or interstate travelers. Also, the kitchen and outdoor bbq was a good set up. Drawback was that the apartment was smaller than I expected but otherwise not much else. It looks just how it is photographed.  "

The location of the house was central to everything, 2 minute walk to QV mall and Melbourne central, so perfect location for all the shopping to be done in melbourne. The house is huge, and my room was great with a comfortable double bed and all the wardrobe space needed. The bathroom I had all to myself for most of my stay as well, which was great. As for sharyn, you couldn't ask for a better host. Super friendly, lovely and even took the time to take me to her usual bars which are now are my favourites! Especially the mulled wine at troika! Roger is awesome and great company as well. Will be back most definitely to stay with Sharyn and Roger again."

There is a great pub and cafe in walking distance, parks all around and yet very close to public transport. It was lovely to wake up to the sounds of native birds rather than cars!
The apartment is well equipped and we enjoyed cooking and eating in. The bed is huge and very comfy so we slept very well, also helped by the good quality linen. 
Rosemary was helpful and available if we needed anything. She is a friendly, warm person and we appreciated having her as our host.

You would hardly think you are in one of the hot spot areas of Melbourne. You might not see her often, but she always checked in to see if everything was alright and has lots of information on where to go and what to see. You will also love the bread and muffins she brings back from her work... 
If I ever make it back my first choice will be her place! "

You can walk here from Parliament station if the train is what you're after, and there are dozens of trams at your doorstep - not to mention great places to eat, and enjoy your stay in Melbourne.

It's not a new unit, but it's well looked after and you'll have a comfortable stay in one of the two spare rooms in the unit.  

Sharyn could not be a more accommodating host. We were able to check in and out at hours that worked around our schedule, and had some great conversation with her when we saw her. She called to check in that we'd made it in OK (as she wasn't about to me there when we checked in) and couldn't have made it more comfortable for us - providing towels and some further information about what to do around the area and how to get around. 

Her dog Roger is also a fine host. 

A highly recommended recent addition to the AirBnB community!

There were even tourist leaflets ready for me in my room for when I arrived! Easy access to get into the apartment, great location by Kew High Street and only few minutes walk to the Tram stop taking you straight to the city. Given I'd never been to Melbourne before but managed to find my way around, in and out the city without any trouble, it was perfect.

The room was comfortable just like the photo shows.
 However it is noisy due to the next door neighbours who seem to like to stay up and party until the wee hours of the Morning this occurred 3 out of the 4 nights I stayed. Also the front door of the house is right beside the guest bedroom door and so you do  hear the family coming and going naturally.
It takes approx 50 or more minutes to get into the city as the walk to the train is at least 15 mins and then the train into the City takes approx 35 mins, so it's not close to the  CBD if you are wanting a night out.  If you have a car it would be fine."

Prior to arriving Ramona shared lots of useful tips which contributed largely to the great experiences we had whilst in Melbourne. She was also happy to answer any additional questions and share her knowledge on things to do in the City.  
 
On our arrival we were welcomed with a lovely warm and clean room. Extra little touches made us feel very welcome from the very start of our stay. Our room had everything we required and more. There were even useful flyers and maps of the city. 

The location was perfect, right in the centre of many shops, restaurants and bars. We only had to walk to the end of the street for fabulous food and drinks. Many of the places we tried were recommended by Ramona and they were all exceptional. 

Unfortunately, my friend visiting from the uk left his iPad in the room, but Ramona very kindly posted it back quickly to ensure he received it before going home. 

A wonderful host right from the start. We are already planning a return visit with friends who were impressed when they saw how lovely the house was.

The Tram is just a few blocks away and plenty of restaurants, the casino and Southgate area all within walking distance. We also enjoyed the bike share bikes - very close to the nearest docking station. Most convenient was the grocery store across the street! Dina was responsive and helpful - even accommodating an early check-in for our travel-weary group. Our wifi wasn't working upon arrival and tech support was also quickly responsive - it was resolved immediately.

On the downside - we found the apartments humid with poor air circulation - especially if using the washer/dryer or showering. The kitchen was very minimally stocked. We had to be creative in cooking endeavors. We rented three apartments - the door on one of the apartments slammed if we didn't manually close it slowly. This definitely disturbed our neighbors and was challenging to remember every time we came/went.

Because our three apartments were located on two different floors and the key fobs only get you onto the floor of your apartment it was challenging to ensure the group was able to gather in the same apartment. If you are renting multiple apartments for a group, we recommend requesting they are all on the same floor if possible.

In general - a good experience."

The little extras of breakfast, water, snacks, toiletries and an evening glass of wine and friendly chat over the tennis went the extra step to making this stay very enjoyable. "
310594,5063544,2013-06-10,6474377,Laura & Annie,100,"We had a great long weekend in Melbourne and absolutely loved Bridget's place. It was pretty cold over the weekend but the treehouse is toasty warm and comfortable. It is has everything you need and is a very cool and relaxing place to stay. It's a great location and Bridget was very friendly and really easy to deal with. We really appreciated the late check out, as we did not fly back to NZ until the evening. I'll stay again and would certainly recommend it."

363278,3959077,2013-03-31,4316985,Lauren,98,Alan and his pets Jack and Amy were the perfect hosts. I enjoyed the warm hospitable cottage and stimulating conversation. The location of Alan's place was also perfectly central. 
363278,27004385,2015-02-23,7319445,Lauren,100,Awesome host and house. Was perfect for discovering everything Melbourne. Would definitely stay again! Thanks Alan!

157427,175823283,2017-07-30,28785943,Lauren,100,"I really enjoyed the green leafy location and proximity to the shops and station, as I was traveling without a car. Margaret was a lovely accommodating host who could reccomend cafes and walks in the area, and the muesli and toast provided for breakfast was delicious. The room was smaller than I expected so may not suit people who have lots of luggage or want to sprawl on a couch, but it was perfect for my needs and I loved the bath (especially after a long day of bush walking). I would recommend this room to anyone wanting a quiet break."
72576,7921900,2013-10-08,195089,Lauren,98,"Just came back from a monthlong trip to Australia. We stayed with Ramona for 2 nights over a weekend nearing the end of our trip. Thus, I was somewhat tired, dirty and weary of moving day to day, place to place. Staying at her place was such a refreshing joy and change of pace from hotels for the following reasons:

First, her location is fantastic. The Fitzroy neighborhood has lovely shops and restaurants and there is very little lodging in the area, so having access to her place gives you access to a neighborhood you could easily spend 2 days in without having to transfer or cab back to the CBD or a hotel.

Second, her upstairs apartment is so separate from the first floor bedrooms, you feel you have the space to yourself. There is a lovely, large shower with window, lots of light, and a side area that serves as a desk and luggage storage zone, keeping the bedroom free from bags if you wish. Although there is a large closet as well.

Third, LAUNDRY! 

Fourth, she left us a chocolate on the bed, a lovely welcome note, maps, let us use the MYKI cards, and basically has everything set up for you to take advantage of the area without doing any legwork on your own. Very welcome after navigating different cities and areas for 27 days.

Fifth, the house is beautifully decorated. There are muffins in the kitchen left for a quick breakfast bite if you need it. There is an outdoor deck to take advantage of the sun, when it comes out.

Finally, Ramona herself is a lovely person. I would 100% stay there again should we find ourselves in Melbourne again.

Thank you Ramona!"

Close to chapel street shopping and night life, but down a quiet side street so it's not too noisy. Would definitely stay again. "
268849,125796461,2017-01-07,46509524,Lauren,92,"Mia was such an amazing host! She was contactable and very communicative about how to get in, great spots in the local area and very generous in letting us check out later - it felt like I was staying with a friend! The apartment was as gorgeous and all the thoughtful styling details made me feel like I was in my home away from home. The location was perfect - close to all my South Yarra favourites, the trams, the trains and a beautiful walk along the Yarra. I will most definitely be back to stay in Mia's apartment and would highly recommend it to anyone who wants to see Melbourne in style. "
72576,40116152,2015-07-28,9000898,Lauren,96,"Ramona's place was perfect in every way - super clean, amenities were as described (if not better!) and the whole place was warm and comfortable.

Ramona is a wonderful host who made every part of my visit easy. She was very welcoming and friendly and goes out of her way to make this such a great place to stay.

Can't recommend this place enough!"
244952,48715367,2015-09-28,756137,Lauren,94,"Rebecca's place is the perfect home base. So conveniently located to Gertrude, Brunswick and Smith Streets, and an easy stroll or tram ride to the city. We walked everywhere and just enjoyed the Fitzroy vibe, there are almost too many great restaurants, cafes and shops to take in just a stone's throw away. The apartment is great value. It was clean and tidy and had everything we could possibly need including towels, linen, hair dryer, kitchen necessities - a real home away from home! We'll be back, thanks so much Rebecca."

Excellent communication before and during your stay. The house has many amenities, including a hot tub, that you are welcome to use. There‚Äôs a market (Cole‚Äôs) very nearby if you wish to buy groceries or alcohol. The neighborhood is quiet and out of the bustle of the city. Romeo, the chocolate lab, is an absolute love. There are three rooms here, so you may also get to meet other travelers!"

I arrived to a beautiful, clean apartment. It's interiors are beautiful and its in such a convenient location. The apartment itself is quiet and fitted with aircon for the visitors convenience, the bed was super comfy and sleep was not an issue. Mia was so helpful and kind throughout my stay and i will definitely be staying here again when i return to Melbourne. Xx"

297350,443380909,2019-04-26,45856660,Lauren,100,"This is a good place to stay in Melbourne in terms of value and uniqueness of the home. The style and furnishings were fun to witness and I have no major complaints. I was a tad disappointed to find out when I got there that the spa was broken, as it‚Äôs in the title of the listing so a main attraction for booking. Unfortunately I was only staying for 2 nights so by the time the spa was fixed, it was not clean/ ready to be used. The main takeaway for me is a good place to stay but probably best to make sure the host is in town to ensure the best experience."
111001,434905758,2019-04-08,7468155,Lauren,100,"This is an amazing experience. As someone traveling alone, I rarely get photos of myself in them, and this was an easy cure. However, the photos are completely secondary in the experience. Yulia is amazing--so sweet, kind, sincere and knowledgeable (both about Tokyo and her art). On top of that, you get to discover all these sweet little pockets of the neighborhood. My only regret is that I didn't do it sooner in my trip!"
268849,74049317,2016-05-12,10494766,Lauren,97,We had a great stay at Mia's apartment.

161033,49800386,2015-10-06,3088408,Lauren,99,"We received a warm welcome by Karen & Michael when we arrived. The cottage is cosy and extremely comfortable, the breakfast was simple but tasty - fresh bread and delicious fruit straight from the tree in the back yard, and it was a delight to see so many kangaroos, birds and the friendly wombat roaming the gorgeous gardens. It's a great spot and very close to lovely wineries and excellent cafes in Healesville!"

Was a little disappointed to be kept but until 3:30am by tenants who live in the house as well.
Bed extremely comfy and not much traffic noise which is always nice. 2 minutes drive to shops where there is a variety of food to eat.
Worth a stay at Ryans :) - just bring ear plugs... just incase."

Ramona's went above and beyond in her home making our short stay in Melbourne so accessible by providing endless information and tips. A short walk or tram ride to town this is prime location and we will defiantly be returning in the near future! "
78143,131804990,2017-02-13,67002989,Lauren K,97,"This place is just great to live feeling like your home. Julie's house is 3 floors building and the 2 rooms which as shown are on the 1st floor. Between the 2 big rooms there is a spacious bathroom having 2 basins and a shower booth just behind the separated room of toilet which is suitable for 3 of us. The house is decorated brightly, colorfully, and artistically. Above all, Julie has a beautiful back yard garden filled with  bunch of stunning flowers that made me smile at any time facing toward.
The whole house is bright and cosy and easy access to get on a train or tram to anywhere. It only takes 10 minutes from Prahran station to Flinders station by train which is just fine to move around.  
And Julie prepared a different bread for every morning which was considerable for the guests, my friends and I really liked that. Thus Julie is a nice person to chat and to ask some help or to get the informations of city of Melbourne. She knows the city well and lots of informations about neighbourhood as well which was great for travellers.
That's what I experienced at this lovely house and with the lovely lady Julie and her adorable dog Flossy who I already miss much."

10803,83960302,2016-07-04,26881617,Laurice,0,"There was a glitch at the beginning as airbnb's routine reminder email didn't reach Lindsay and he wasn't expecting me. However, he responded promptly to my phone call and we were able to sort out a satisfactory solution. The room was exactly as described, and very warm and welcoming. I found the kitchen a little daunting, but that's not unusual for me. I enjoyed my stay in the room, and liked  chatting with Lindsay when we happened to be there at the same time. The flat is character-filled and interesting, and the neighbourhood suited me. Having trams and buses right outside was fantastic, and there was no obviously disturbing noise factor - even the pub music stopped at a reasonable hour."

She keeps her place well organized, tidy and clean and I felt comfortable staying there. The bed was very comfortable and very supportive. The place is just a very short walk to the train station so would be great for anyone trying to get around by public transport. You have to like cats to stay here because her lovely little cat will really like you. I have hardly ever seen such a friendly and inquisitive cat. Thank you Chloe."

257149,9078650,2013-12-05,8229326,Lawrence,98,"Initially when I booked, I had some reservation about airbnb service. Especially after reading some negative reviews and comments online.

After we arrived at Lanie's place we felt much better and safer. Lanie is a very warm and helpful host, she went through with us some of the thing which we can do around the area, gave us some maps, and showed us how to operate some of the appliances at her place.

For those of you who are skeptical like me. Rest assure and worry not, Lanie is a wonderful host. The photos which she posted of her home is almost exactly as what we found when we reached there. There is wireless internet, 2 clean and cosy bedrooms, furnished kitchen for us to prepare some simple meals, and a washing machine to wash some dirty laundry. It's literally move in ready condition. Location of the place is ideal as it's just a short walk from High street where there are many eating places and a supermarket nearby for all your other daily necessities. 

I highly recommend Lanie's place to everyone. "

307630,3664151,2013-03-01,5143701,Lawrence,98,"My partner and I spent a week at Sharyn's home in Melbourne. It's located close to many places of interest, like QV Mall, Melbourne Museum, China Town and Swantson Street with many restaurants, cafes and shops! Sharyn is a friendly host who made us feel at home from the day we have arrived. She made sure our stay was comfortable and offered us help on places to go and visit around Melbourne. 

Regarding the recent bad review on her, I would like to say that Sharyn does not mention anywhere that it is a near-like 5 star hotel experience or standard. For the price you pay, it is much better than a 6 - mixed dorm, bunk bed share room in a backpackers, that is located above a nightclub/pub. She is upfront on the condition of her home as it is not brand new and modern, but from what we can see, she tries her best to make every guests' stay pleasant.  I would highly recommend this place to anyone. 

Cheers for a wonderful stay!
Bernice and Lawrence

307615,317245646,2018-09-02,49836908,Lawrence,100,"Sharon was a great host. She was always around when I can back from work and was -always keen for a chat. The location of this house is unbeatable as it is in the middle of the heart of the CBD with food and groceries around. I think her house is more suited for people that aren‚Äôt planning on staying home all day. The house does not get a lot of natural sunlight and can get pretty cold in the winter. That being said, there are plenty of blankets, a very comfortable bed, and a small heater."

He not only provided tourist information for our reference but also led us a stylish Jazz bar and local Ozi brunch shop. In addition, his room is much bigger than the pic, and living room is well decorated with full of his dreams and imaginations. We both were feeling lucky to meet him and live his house.

The bed was comfortable, bathroom and kitchen very clean and check-in easy. The location was quiet at night but still close to everywhere we needed to go- a short tram ride or walk into the city, and an even shorter walk to local cafes and restaurants. Standouts are the shower and the view to the lovely courtyard!"

The property was immaculately presented and spotlessly clean. Massive room with heaps of storage space and a huge ensuite. The bed was so comfortable, it made getting up in the mornings quite a challenge.

This really is in a great location and as in the description everything you need is within walking distance, including the train station which is very convenient.

Would definitely recommend Raewyn ( and Oscars ) home for travellers in this area. Definitely hope to stay again."

Totally recommend this apartment to anyone. It's just fabulous. 

Thank you for a positive stay, Dee and Daryl. "

I stayed at Lorettas in order to find a permanent place to live. Loretta, her son and cousin couldn't have been more helpful and generous. Andre, her son lent me his own TV throughout my stay and Loretta's cousin - Michael makes great tea. I found it a very relaxed household where I could retreat into my comfortable bedroom or enjoy stimulating conversation with the family. Eating-in is no problem. I was provided with a small fridge of my own and space in the main fridge if need be. I highly recommend 'a room near the park.'

The hosts were wonderful with our late check in and attending to a minor issue with the bathroom very quickly. Thoroughly recommend if coming to Melbourne (in particular the south side) for families or a group. The apartment was very comfortable and relaxing with all the amenities and very welcoming hosts! They even gave us a bottle of wine on arrival which was a lovely touch were very understanding as we accidentally cracked a glass panel of their balcony door!! Thank you Susanne and Giuseppe!

Coming from a coastal Queensland town,  it was an absolute treat to experience the fascinating eclectic artistic ambience of Ramona's  space and of such an interesting suburb. Beautiful vintage shops and a plethora of restaurants and cafes of every description. Try Arcadia, just around the corner. Friendly, fresh and funky caf√© for a morning pick me up. Ramona has many of her own suggestions which helped we strangers enormously. 

Ramona is a communicator extraordinaire! We knew so much before even arriving, and checkin was a breeze. 

Water and glasses on the bedside table, earplugs in the drawer (just in case!) , white towelling dressing gowns behind the door and chemical free toiletries in the bathroom were the kindest touches. 

We came for theatre and found so much more. 15 minutes walk to The Princess theatre. Ramona gave us so many tips. we'll be back to try them all out."

We stayed for the month of February and had a wonderful time.  The location is only a block away from the University of Melbourne, the grocery store and bakery, and Lygon Street which has so many restaurants/cafes to choose from.  A 20-25 minute walk will take you to the Victoria Market or to Chinatown.  We did not have a car so we walked most of the time.  There are numerous trams that stop at the University when you want to go further or don't feel like walking.
     The apartment was well equipped with everything needed to cook your own food although with so many restaurants close by you may not want to.  The bed was comfortable.  Check in and out was easy.  It was nice to have a bottle of Australian wine waiting for us when we arrived.  We highly recommend this apartment.

The apartment was very clean, spacious, warm, well stocked and beautifully furnished, it became a real little haven for me!  Punt raod and Bridge street are very busy and there is traffic noise, but it didn't disturb me, and it was worth it given how central and well located this aprtment is.  I was 15 minutes from Auburn where my course was, and 20 minutes walk to the centre of the city (much quicker by tram).  The tram stop was a 2 minute walk (very safe getting home late at night) and the train station was a 10 minute walk. Bridge street is fantastic, full of life, shopping, good cafes and supermarkets. Marylin was an excellent host, reliable and helpful.  Even though she is in France, she contacted me regularly to make sure I was alright.  The apartment is also very safe, I was there by myself and felt safe the whole time. I highly recommend this apartment and will try and would stay there again next time in Melbourne. "

Her home is very large and the pride Ramona takes in decorating with vintage and modern things makes you feel like you're getting your money's worth.

This place lived up to the expectations I had after reading all the rave reviews on Airbnb. Both the house and room were extremely clean and well kept. What I really appreciated were the little touches such as the flowers in the room and the nicely wrapped Wallpaper guide book. I knew I was in good hands the minute I stepped inside my room. 

Besides, this is such a charming hood to stay! There's so much to explore and so many little quirky shops in the area that sets it apart from the other parts of Melbourne. I managed to try some places in the area which were all walking distance from Ramona's - Cutler & Co (excellent food), Sonido (Ramona's recommendation. This place has so much character. Must go) and a little French creperie called Breizoz (great crepes).

363278,52570441,2015-10-31,36784363,Lisa,96,"I had a wonderful week-long stay at Alan's gorgeous house in Fitzroy. Alan could not have been more accomodating, from the greeting at the top of the road on arrival, to breakfast every morning (nothing like tea out of a proper teapot!), the transport to my course early in the mornings. I cannot thank you enough, Alan. You made my stay so easy and relaxing.
The room is great with a little table to work on and armchairs to sit in. Super comfy bed too.
Fitzroy is a wonderful suburb in which to stay; so much more interesting than the city centre. The cafes, boutique shops and restaurants are a joy to explore. I only wish I had more time to while away a few hours.
I highly recommend a stay at Alan and Jack's place, you will not regret it."

One note to travellers:  internet is available by using an ""air card"" type stick, which can be purchased and activated locally.  Some of the U.S. carriers for email, such as verizon, cannot be accessed, so you might want to set up email with an international seach engine, like (Hidden by Airbnb) ."
331605,9890265,2014-01-17,6142324,Lisa,100,"My family of 5 had an enjoyable stay in Melbourne despite continuous 40 degree heat. The apartment had good air conditioning and was reasonably spacious. It was well located and in any other weather would have been easy walking distance to most attractions. It was, however, not ready on arrival and not very clean with a  number of basics missing.  To Dina's credit, she responded immediately to my text and organised for most of the issues to be addressed the following day. Others were not able to be addressed. The couch needs a good clean. The beds were very comfortable and the pool was great to have available."

244952,20500275,2014-09-30,32767,Lisa,95,"The Treehouse in Fitzroy was the first airbnb apartment I have stayed in here in Australia, normally I stay in hotels. My friend and I were down for the AFL Grand Final and this proved a better option price wise. The apartment is a 10 min walk from Brunswick St but it is very quiet. It has a tram route on both ends of the street, the closest being 5 min away. Everything you need is at the front of this place! The Foodworks is close if you need grocery supplies but there are so many places to eat out from. The bed is comfortable, the apartment is spotless, the shower is hot and relaxing , the kitchen is stocked with everything you need to cook and there is a friendly cat called Bruce who lives downstairs that likes to visit. The balcony is lovely to sit out on and read the paper and take in the serenity. It is going to be the ONLY place we stay when we go to Melbourne. A hidden gem!"
247140,19232882,2014-09-08,6516596,Lisa,80,There was very clear instructions and helpful information left for us. It was a perfectly cute place to stay - would stay again and would recommend to others. 
256186,201175566,2017-10-08,478381,Lisa,97,"This is a great apartment to stay in for short term travellers. 

We had fantastic communication with Hoang and Michael and they were prompt to rectify some issues we had when checking in. 

The apartment itself is close to Smith St and nearby some great bars, cafes and restaurants along with the tram that takes you straight into the city. 

There was significant noise from neighbours in the morning which was our only issue. 

If you are allergic to feather pillows like I am, bring your own. On the whole a good stay."
38271,48189409,2015-09-24,4944561,Lisa,91,This is a wonderful place to stay.  Everything was perfect and very comfortable.  I really enjoyed coming home after a long day out. Shops and all you need within a minutes drive.  I highly recommend staying in this lovely home!

257915,22824168,2014-11-16,17857090,Lisa,96,"We had booked 2 of Dina's apartments for a girls weekend and they fit our needs perfectly. The linen and towels provided were clean, and the kitchen was big enough to accommodate our cooking requirements. The bathrooms were tidy and in working condition, and basics were provided (hair dryer, toilet paper, toiletries). There were renovations in the lobby downstairs, however the concierge was easily accessible and helpful. We didn't meet Dina, but as there was a concierge, they were able to help us with any questions we had. There was even free coffee in the lobby on the saturday morning! We also were able to use the car parks provided with each apartment. I can highly recommend this venue for value for money and location. We very much enjoyed our stay there."

They realised (with no prompts) after we arrived that the bed configuration was not as we‚Äôd requested and sent housekeeping back the next day to sort it out. Some lovely touches with dvds, books and a board game available in the event you want to relax at home; really close to the restaurants & bars of St Kilda or a quick tram ride to town. We‚Äôll be recommending it to our friends!"

Their emails before we arrived were very welcoming and Michael met my husband who arrived a few days before me and was very friendly.  A thoughtful bowl of fruit was left for us, together with milk and other essentials.
The place looks like it did online.  It is in a great location... we love staying in Fitzroy.  It was very private and great for our purpose."

It's a lovely space and we enjoyed the views over the city, especially at night. Very well equipped with everything you need, including a/c over the bed and fans. A shame the roof space can't really be used but I'm guessing this might happen in the future. 
Easy to find and on the second floor with the tattoo parlour below you (they were lovely neighbours!)
Michelle was super helpful and answered all our questions while we were there.

Ripponlea Station is just about 10 minutes away, with links directly to the city so the location is great!

167067,127491831,2017-01-18,93400386,Loes,80,"John's place is in a quiet and nice neighbourhood. You can park your car easy. The train to the station is on a 5 min walk, it takes 30 minutes to the city centre. John is very interested in what you do, what time you are at home and how you behave in his house. We stayed four nights at his place, but we didn't feel home. He was all the time around in the living room, thats why we just stay in the sleeping room. For us as a young couple, wouldn't recommend this place to young people who want to have some privacy. We are for sure John has all good intentions and he is good for someone who wants to have deep conversations, but for us it was a little bit akward sometimes."

Chris was a wonderful, caring and very informative host. It doesn't matter what time we had to get up in the morning, he was always up before us going to bakery for yummy chocolate croissants and pastries! It's no wonder we had to walk so much to work it all off! LOL! He took the time to draw us maps and recommend neighbourhoods and places to eat. His home is perfectly located with an easy 20 minute walk to the beach and perhaps another 20-30 minutes to where there are lots of eateries and shops. We even walked all the way to the downtown area!  Thanks so much, Chris, for making our stay in Melbourne so pleasurable! And thanks so much for our parting gift!"

But on top of that, the house is absolutely incredible and Ramona herself, is an exceptional host! Her generosity was amazing. Everything was so well organised and precise making my life very easy when I arrived in Melbourne. 

The upstairs level with the ensuite was perfect - Ramona had even left maps, brochures, business cards and great little books on Melbourne and the area that we were staying in - Fitzroy. Towels, bathrobes, and drinking water next to the bed also added to the already lovely experience. 

In this house, you really don't feel like you're living in each others pockets. It's very spacious, bright and airy. There's also a heap of DVDs and a cozy couch if you're feeling like a night in :)

Ramona's incredible house really topped off my Melbourne trip, and I'll be sure to stay there again next time i'm in Melbourne. Do yourself a favour, and STAY THERE! Thanks Ramona!"

The apartment was comfy, great living room and the kitchen had everything you need to cook. For the cold winter days you have a heater in the bedroom and living room, it was more than enough. 

The location couldn't be better. East Melbourne is one of the nicest areas. Three mins walk for the tram, but if you walk 6-7 mins more you'll get into the free tram zone. Very calm suburb.

Haydn was always there (via mobile phone or AirBnb), he even offered to to take care of my bags when I arrived to Melbourne. Definitely a great experience. "

The area was great - within walking distance from the CBD, but in reality, we couldn't think of many reasons to leave fitzroy! Plenty of restaurants, and loads of things to do with the kids.

We stayed over christmas, and on christmas day Lulu's son popped over with gifts, which was lovely. 

We enjoyed our stay so much, we have booked to stay for another fortnight at the end of our trip in February.

There are notes all over the apartment so you know how things work. It seems like she has thought of everything. The apartment is nice. It is simple and just every thing you need for a stay in Thornbury. I can tell care was put into decorating it and making it comfortable. The apartment is literally just two blocks away from High Street and one block away from the train to Fitzroy.... So basically convenient to all the shops and cafes you could possibly want. I wish we could stay longer! Highly recommended hostess and apartment!

Tons of sun, located near amazing shops and food (The Piano.. best thai!!), and close to public transport and parks. We loved the office/guest room.. amazing natural light. The only setbacks were the not-the-comfiest bed and the limited wifi; there was trouble with the router, and there's only 1GB included per month so we had to purchase our own wifi. Other than that, A+. We also purchased a nutribullet and some kitchenware and left it there so.. enjoy! Would stay again!!"

Ramona was very attentive and responsive to our communications and her casual hospitality gives us freedom to feel at home in her house. I love that she leaves chocolate on our door as a welcome treat and all the information booklets, maps, pamphlets, business cards she had provided us so we can find our way around Fitzroy. And I love her DVD collection, perfect after a long day of adventure to sleep through a movie. The place is clean and cozy. Even when we stay at the smaller bedroom we thought she had made the room so comfortable and the bed is an absolute heaven. We had to check where the quilts from! We won't hesitate to go back here again for another stay in lovely Little George :) Thank you Ramona!"

If I could give this Air BnB more that 5 stars I would : Beyond excellent, ticked every box.

Linda is a perfect hostess.  She is a very welcoming, friendly, interesting to talk to, fun, energetic, generous, wonderful and an inspiring lady.

The photo's of her town house, 2D on the web, in real life, it is an interior designers dream : beautifully decorated, exceptionally comfortably bedroom with own bathroom and spotlessly clean.  With a great variety of food to choose from to make breakfast, the morning dining experience is topped of with an nespresso.

As hostess, Linda provided me with a Myki card (3 in fact!) and gave me with directions to where I needed to go when I ask her.  

Her friends are a joy to behold, once again, fascinating and fun to share time with.

Linda also has a beautiful dog (puppy at 8months), Boof, who is very playful and his greeting is a treat to behold.  

I have recommended this place to many many friends in Melbourne and back in WA, and would definitely come back and stay.

Linda : thank you : it was my pleasure meeting you.

When I arrived, Mario and I had a great chat, getting to know each other, advising me where I could go, and helping me book my Great Ocean Road tour. He really took the time to give me such a warm welcome that I instantly felt right at home! Throughout my stay, he would check how I was doing during the day and tell me places I could go to which I really appreciate. Every time I heard from Mario or spoke with him, I felt he was genuinely interested and sincere. Truly a Super Host! :-)

I love his apartment too! The location is really convenient, the room is spacious, and the bed is super comfortable (I had a hard time getting up in the morning :-D). The balcony is great too!

I would definitely consider staying with Mario again! The whole experience was such a delight and made me embrace the Airbnb experience!

And the gorgeous open plan living area is the perfect place to relax with a cup of tea and delicious Fatto a Mano baked goods before heading out. There is even an amazing selection of movies to curl up on the couch with, if you're lucky enough to have the time!

Judy‚Äôs apartment really is a home from home; comfortable and welcoming with everything you need. It has fabulous views and is close to the tram for the city or down St Kilda Road. The city itself is just minutes away.
As I was in Melbourne for study I took the opportunity to chill out in front of the telly with Judy in the evening and she is superb, warm and interesting company. I feel like I‚Äôve made a new friend.

Nestled at the end of a safe, quiet, and charming alleyway in the heart of Fitzroy, we found the place easily. Lulu was there to greet us and was the most wonderful host: she gave us a tour of the house, and then spent time with us talking about the area, things to do, recommendations on where to eat & drink. We told her the kinds of things we were wanting to do and see, and she marked suggestions on a map for us! Lulu is clearly passionate about Fitzroy, and her enthusiasm was infectious! We visited many of the places she recommended, and they were all great. 
The place was lovely and clean, and looks exactly like the pictures. There were lots of lovely little details like the nice soaps and the fully stocked bathroom cupboards (which contained everything from tissues to band-aids), as well as maps and guidebooks, a range of teas, and two myki cards. There was even a bowl of fresh fruit on the kitchen table for us to enjoy.
The house holds the heat of the day very nicely, but the air conditioning unit also works wonders on those too-hot Melbourne afternoons. 
It is just minutes away from lovely little shops and cafes, and around the corner from the 86 tram stop, which gets you into the city within 15 minutes. 
Lulu was always quick to respond to our text messages throughout our trip (she even helped us out by giving us directions when we took the wrong tram when we first arrived in Melbourne!).

While the photos are impressive, the house itself is more so. The complex is a sanctuary only footsteps from all that Port Melbourne offers (literally 3 minutes walk to the beach, and 6 minutes to Bay Street). Linda is warm, generous, interesting, engaging and has a gift of making you feel totally at home, in her home .. as does Boof, who was a a very welcome bonus ;)
This was my first AirBnB .. and what a wonderful introduction .. looking forward to my next, and Linda‚Äôs place will be top of my list, when visiting this local.
Thank you Linda and Boof ;)))"

268849,785567,2011-12-14,482843,Malcolm,98,Mia is a lovely lady and great host.  She was there to werlcome us even though our flight was delayed.  She gave us lots of tips on MEL which was helpful.  The apartment is new light and airy with all you need.  There is parking in the building - which is great for this location but with South Yarra station a stone's throw and only two stops to CBD don;t bother with the car!  One small word of warning - when the Szechuan Chinese nearby say ONE chilli they mean TEN chilllis - be careful!

The house was grubby and was not professionally cleaned. 
Linen and bed sheets were stained 
Kitchen pantry and fridge was full of food belonging to owner and previous occupants 
House was full of Bali fragile antiques  prone to breaking. (Child unfriendly)
Dust everywhere 
Laundry was filthy full of cleaning stuff and rubbish
Many other negative things I can go on forever 
Was worst experience that I will regret and my family are disappointed that I booked that place and we have wasted our holiday time and money."

The most outstanding feature, is of course Lulu,  she is a wonderful host, this type personal experience is priceless. Friendly, informative, helpful and super efficient with communication. Throw away the guide books just let Lulu know your interests and with her local knowledge you need no more.  We loved exploring the area with its quite terrace streets, but 5 minutes from the cafes, bars and vibrant buzz of Brunswick,Smith and Gertrude Streets
So happy with our choice of area. Fitzroy and Lulus place suited our needs perfectly. Walking distance to everything.
The studio is warm, light and cosy. We were 2 female friends staying 3 nights, so loved the seperate sleeping arrangements. Quiet, leafy garden and rooftop views. The kitchen has everything you need but we loved treating ourselves to the delicious food and beverage that seem to be all around us. Who can resist.
Loved Melbourne and Lulus will be our resting place when we return to discover more of this grand old city. Thank you Lulu for your amazing hospitality and sharing your home with us."
72576,15496100,2014-07-10,15830244,Mandy,96,"Place was clean and tidy. A little dark around the entrance, which is off a narrow dark alley.  Needed the iphone torch to find the keyhole.

Would have liked some coffee and milk (tea and soy milk doesn't work for me before work)

Its not for everyone.  I am a big bed and breakfast person over the past 20 years, this was quite a different experience.  Didn't feel like I was a guest.  My daughter and I shared the bed, which was 'ok', but I wouldn't recommend non couples to share.

Room was warm and cozy, nice for a couple. Kitchen was good enough to cook all our meals, even John has some utensils to cook our typical meal, like dumpling cooking pot, chapati roller etc.
TV is there, but we did not watch much. Wifi is fast and good enough to watch HD movies.
Children's park is nearby. Chadstone shopping center is 20 minutes by bus, city central is 30 minutes by train.

I really didn't spend much time in the apartment as I was just out and about the whole weekend; but resting and recharging was perfect. I was able to check in early as Mario was flexible with this and had a chance to relax in the heated pool after my flight. All clean, organized and trendy looking. Even perfect small details in the room such as umbrella (which was very handy as I forgot mine!), travelling books and guides, toiletries, and an all start tour guide which is Mario himself. Maybe the only negative thing was me not being able to spend more time with this awesome host. 5 star host and 5 star room. Many thanks!"

Note: If you're bringing a car... There is absolutely no parking available close to the apartment. It's only residents' parking (permit).

She knows her neighborhood - probably the best in Melbourne for eating, drinking and shopping - like the back of her hand.

She's also an excellent communicator, which was hugely helpful in getting to and into the apartment after arriving in Melbourne.

Her apartment was stylish but also very homely. It was a great place to chill out when we needed to recharge our batteries.

The bedroom was big, with a double wardrobe for storage and an extremely comfortable bed. The deck outside was also a nice little sun trap.

My only disappointment was that we didn't get to talk about Flying Nun bands over a pint at the pub. Maybe next time?

Thanks again for having us.

Thank you Alan"

I have only stayed in entire places before and have always been a bit reluctant to book a private room. I needn't have worried as Alan was welcoming, courteous and made me feel very at ease and comfortable. Alan's home is a beautiful and peaceful haven from the bustle of Fitzroy though incredibly close to transport, restaurants and shops. I'm looking forward to spending an idle hour or two in the gorgeous garden, perhaps patting Jack or the cat, on my next visit."

Her town house is superb, so light and modern and right in the heart of everything you want to do in Fitzroy. Her lane-way is real Melbourne- urban art and a uber cool coffee place at the end where you can indulge in some of the best coffee on the planet. George Street is full of the most interesting and unusual shops and there are more vintage 50s style men's barber shops than you can imagine. Ramona is very friendly and extremely helpful and leaves you to do your own thing. The upstairs room is spacious and private and the kitchen/living area delightful. All you see on the website is just as it is. We recommend entirely. "

163077,211464219,2017-11-13,150822219,Maria Cristina,0,"We rented this apartment for one month. It has nice natural light and decoration details. However we believe the apartment isn‚Äôt suitable for anyone trying to find a ‚Äúhome away from home‚Äù, to live normally, cook and enjoy your stay by being yourself in the apartment. The reason for this is that practically any movement in the apartment triggers the complains of the tenant of the apartment below. We had her addressing us complaining about noise, while we were still bringing our luggage upstairs (hadn‚Äôt even started our stay yet). If you are planning on staying for a couple of days only, eating out and using the apartment as a hotel, this might not be an issue for you.
Apart from this constant annoyance of trying to live like in ‚Äúsuper quiet‚Äù mode, our stay was ok. Unfortunately, I have to mention that our last day has forever marked our stay and our opinion on the hosts.
The morning on the 13 th of November, a family friend and our grandson (2 years old) were visiting us. Since he was falling asleep, we asked our friend to stay with him in the apartment while we went to get something to eat. In this time, two men opened the apartment door (there are two more security doors before this door in the building) and starting harassing our friend, who was understandably scared, roughly demanding her to leave the house and accusing her of illegally staying in the apartment (she lives in a 5 bedroom house in Melbourne). We were shocked at the way they screamed at her in front of our two-year old grandson, completely disregarding the fact that they were frightening a child (who does that?!). When these men calmed down we realised that the problem was that we had misunderstood the check out date by one day (there is a 14hs time difference between Melbourne and our hometown) and we were in the middle on unpacking a one month stay when they were expecting to find an empty apartment. They then took the keys away from her, basically trapping her and our grandson inside the apartment until we arrived, since there is no way of re-entering the apartment once you leave without the keys. 

Our family friend contacted my daughter and my son-in-law, who both had to leave work, fearing for their son‚Äôs safety. We ended up having to empty the apartment in 45 minutes. 
We accept our confusion with the check-out date but the way they managed the situation was completely unacceptable and a terrible finalization of our stay in Melbourne. You can see in every communication that these men don‚Äôt go by the Airbnb values, they just want to the most make money out of their properties at any cost. We are never staying with these people again."

She and her partner even have and tend to a garden across the street! Bridget was communicative and warm, and she left us Myki cards to use for our stay which I found to be a thoughtful touch.

Frank and Vince were super responsive to some wifi issues we had and resolved them promptly.  Would highly recommend them as hosts and this apartment.  Perfect for 2-3 people! "

He accepted my prenotation quickly even though it was a last minute one and was up late at night to welcome me. The room was comfortable, the heating really appreciable in those cold winter days. I was pretty busy that week and didn't spend much time home but it was a great first air bnb experience."

The whole apartment was very clean and it has everything you need for a few days in Melbourne. It was great to have an own bathroom. The apartment is very close to the tram station and therefore you can reach the city very easy (direct lines to the centre). Nice and calm neighborhood. I felt very safe there. Nothing to complain about. I can highly recommend this accomodation!

215787,4072239,2013-04-08,3652143,Marie,100,"We stayed at Marilyn's apartment in Melbourne for a few months in the summer/autumn while travelling around Australia on working holiday visas. The apartment itself is in one of the best locations in Melbourne - just outside the city (15 mins walk) and next to loads of shops, restaurants and parks, with a tram stop right on the corner, getting you into the city in 5 mins. It worked out well for us working at the MCG, as it's only a 5 minute walk from the apartment. Richmond itself is very safe, and you could easily walk home on your own at night if you needed to. The only downfall is that all the cars driving down Punt Road can be a bit noisy, but we got used to that fairly quickly and it wasn't a problem for us. The apartment has everything you could possibly need in it, and is decorated beautifully so that you feel like you're at home rather than just visiting. Marilyn herself is absolutely lovely. She phoned us from France before we left for Australia to let us know how to check in, and made sure that we had all the directions we needed. She was in touch with us all throughout our stay to make sure that things were going well, and she helped us out when we decided to extend our time in Melbourne. As far as places to stay go, we highly recommend Marilyn's apartment. We can't imagine having stayed anywhere else, and we would definitely stay there again if we come back to Melbourne!"

The bed was extremely comfortable to sleep in and we enjoyed the privacy we had with bathroom, bedroom and balcony on our own level. We appreciated the small thoughtful touches, like water next to the bed, delicious bread and spreads for breakfast and a little first aid kit (that we ended up needing!) Ramona was very friendly and generous in sharing her home, and offered wonderful tips and helpful directions around the area bordered by Smith, Brunswick and Gertrude streets, which are fantastic spots to visit - we spent almost all our time in Melbourne there! We also really liked the decor of vintage pieces, which were well-maintained and cared for, very reflective of our experience at Ramona's!"

Julie had quite an array of brochures and maps on hand and suggested various things worth seeing in Melbourne city as well as giving me a run down on the public transport system.

Julie's house is about 1 minute walk from the bus stop which goes to a nearby train station and the journey into the city from there is about 30 mins by train.

I would totally recommend Julie as a host"

Perfect location for exploring the city and having easy access to public transport and food. We love the guys at Manchester Press under Michelle's apartment.

He took me for a drive to see some sights, helped me find a suitable musical to watch, showed me where the Catholic Cathedral was for Sunday mass and invited me to join him and his friends for dinner. So I got to experience a little bit of Melbourne's night life which was fantastic! His friends were very nice as well.

Accommodation was great too. Good security, amenities and excellent location (very central). Apartment was clean with good views. Loved having an ensuite in my bedroom. Heating was good and the bed was very comfortable.

Mario made me feel at home and offered assistance if ever I needed any while I was out and about. He was a real gentleman. This made me feel safe since it was my first trip to Melbourne and my first Airbnb experience.  Thanks Mario for an awesome stay in Melbourne!"

67211,45091325,2015-08-31,35174997,Mark,80,"Having it be a pleasure to stay with Kate would be an understatement. To me, I viewed her more as a 'friend' than merely a host. Perhaps since I had to stay two+ weeks, we had the opportunity to get to know one another and various aspects of our respective lives. However given her welcoming disposition, I feel she would most definitely be like this, no matter how long or short your stay is.

Kate will truly make you feel right at home where you will feel no awkwardness whatsoever. She is incredibly easygoing, and never makes you feel you have to tip-toe around her house. 

She's a wonderful conversationalist when you're both sharing the common areas of the apartment, but she will also give you plenty of space and privacy if need be.

You couldn't ask for a better location to a plethora of amenities close-by: tram stops, post office, cafes, drug stores, supermarkets, mini-marts, bakeries, specialty foods, ethnic eateries, and a myriad of other stores for all of your needs - all within 5 - 10 minutes from her address.

Very clean environment, both inside her apartment (she's got one heck of a comfy bed too!) and her surrounding peaceful neighbourhood. It's an extremely quiet, safe area, with a quaint view of the locale from her room to help lighten up your mornings.

You definitely won't be disappointed if you choose this gracious, hospitable host and wonderful location. Will certainly be returning the next time I'm in the city!"

Frankly, the pictures don't do justice to how quaint and interesting the place really is.  I actually found myself spending quite a bit of time just walking around the house and appreciating the various artworks and antiques he's collected from his travels around the world.    Do take the time to listen to him recount stories from his adventures across the globe.  Alan is certainly a man with many experiences to share.

Apart from the place, the neighbourhood's really worth a mention.  I had no idea what I was getting myself into when I booked my stay with Alan.  Fitzroy is a neighbourhood with a lot of character, and Alan was very kind to point me to many interesting places to visit.  The streets of Collingwood/Fitzroy are dotted with quirky shops and amazing graffiti art.  I would recommend allocating at least one morning to trot around his neighbourhood.  Be sure to ask Alan for a few recommendations on what to focus on!"

The neighborhood is lively but the house is quiet and comfortable.  The room was a good size and the bed was very comfortable. Everything was super clean. Ramona was very easy to coordinate with and gave great instructions on checking in. We only meet briefly but she was very friendly and helpful. Definitely a grear bnb."

76867,9873705,2014-01-16,9316997,Mark,96,"South Melbourne is a part of this great town that we had not visited before. We were very impressed by how easy it is to get to any destination either by foot or tram. There are a huge number of restaurants in the area. The Domain Interchange (2 Min walk from Judys' ) at the top of Park street allowed us to go anywhere on the tram network. This was our first ""Trial"" of the airbnb system and we were initially not sure of what was the correct way to act and interact with our host. Judy helped us settle in and was most helpful in reassuring us that we were not intruders in her home but her guests ( friends after a 4 nights !). This was down to her ability to know when to interact with us and when to politely excuse herself and retire to her on room. We will definitely be returning to Judys' in the future."

She knew her area and wanted to put you at ease in the process of taking photos.    I have never been one that liked taking pictures, my wife on the other hand....   This was a pleasure and I suggest it to be a great way to see sights, discover in a deeper way the community and to get quality photo in the same adventure.

Thanks Yulia, and we look forward to seeing the photos.

The bright and spacious house is fully equipped with everything you might need and the bed is s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) comfortable it's luxurious!  

Ramona is an excellent and knowledgeable host who takes every step to ensure you have everything you need to make for a comfortable stay.  Her personal touch such as providing providing maps and tourist info is really helpful, and as for the bread and muffins she provides - Mmmmmm!!!  "

So close to everything you don‚Äôt really need a car. Walking distance to St Kilda‚Äôs famous Acland Street and the even cooler Carlisle Street. But if you do decide to drive, the car park is a huge bonus. The space is huge!  Amazing for a family of 4! And the place is tucked away from the busy streets so well that you will have no issues sleeping at all. Besides, the bed is one of the most comfortable beds you are ever going to sleep in! Frank and Vince have pretty much thought of everything. Communication was was positive. Most messages were answered within a 12 hour turn around time. And all check in/out instructions were accurately given. So all in all, a very smooth, comfortable and enjoyable stay. This is one gem of a place! Definitely worth your consideration!"

263871,10899528,2014-03-12,9068463,Mark,100,"We are a senior couple who come to Melbourne every summer for two months in January and February. The Apartment was perfect for us. 
There are lots of positives:
Great location, in walking distance of Federation Sq. and Flinders St. Station, Victoria Market, The Arts Centre, Chinatown, and lots of great restaurants. Trams and trains are very close.
Great wifi, we ran a lap top and two iPads flawlessly.
Comfortable bed, lots of closet space, 
A good kitchen. We used the island counter for our meals, but there is a separate table and chairs, if needed.
Since it was summer, we particularly appreciated the great shower, and the Juliette balcony which catches the morning sun.
There was a record heat wave for 5 days in Melbourne, and the air conditioner did a great job.
The office area just off the sitting room, allowed us to set up our laptop and my files in a separate area.
Arrival and departure was very easy.
Be aware, that the location is on a city street with two high rise offices across the street. The sound from the street seems to get echoed. So loud revelers particularly on weekends, and rubbish trucks early in the morning can be intrusive. It was easy for us to mitigate this, as the bedroom has double glazing and with the air con on during the summer, we muted most of the disturbance. Plus we are city people, used to city sounds.
And the high rise buildings play havoc with TV reception.
Neither of these will stop us from returning."

The location is exceptionally convenient. There was some noise on the Saturday night (a party nearby we think) however the other nights were quiet.

Highly recommended!

256186,6043441,2013-07-28,430278,Mark,100,"We spent two wonderful weeks at Hoang's warehouse apartment with our two children. The apartment is beautifully furnished, filled with everything you could want and with plenty of space for your own things. Hoang has thought of everything, including Myki (public transportation) cards, a high chair, luxurious sheets and an abundance of quality towels. There is no dryer, but everything dried overnight next to the heater, which kept the place warm even in winter. Hoang and family live upstairs and are very helpful, available when you have a question, but they give you plenty of privacy. 
The apartment is steps away from all the stores, restaurants and cafes of Smith street, a tram stop, and a supermarket. Highly recommended! We'll stay here again when we go back to Melbourne. "

Richmond as a place to stay is very convienient. The Tram  just takes a few minutes to the City-Center or you can catch the Tram south to St. Kilda. 
In walking distance to the appartment are also a few very nice restaurants. I recommend Gipsy & Mosquito for breakfast and the Japanese Restaurant is a must for dinner.
But for dinner a short walk up to Victoria Street is also a must. Just ask Loren for the good spots! :-)"

His place is quircky, which I liked, lots of interesting art. I did not so much enjoy using the kitchen as it was dirty. Lots of stickyness. Our room was okay, but could also have been a lot cleaner (dusty and some unwelcoming stains in the bedsheets). The bathroom was not as bad as the kitchen, the shower seems relatively clean."

The room we stayed in was immaculate - she left maps, tips on what's interesting around Fitzroy, newsletters for us to browse and plan our trip. The house was very comfortably furnished and all with a personal touch. The place itself was nestled in a very happening suburb. There are lots of good restaurants and cafes nearby so going out for food is never a problem.

The neighbourhood has lots of great eateries and cafes nearby, and there is no shortage of activities and shopping.
Our room was large and we had exclusive use of the bathroom as there was no one else staying at the home.
However, there was very poor WiFi reception in the actual room and this made booking online tours etc. troublesome. To his credit, Colin did offer us freedom to use the WiFi on the main floor where the signal was stronger.
Colin invited us to use the main kitchen which we greatly appreciated. Both he and Jung were very friendly, and it was a pleasure getting to know them both."

With cool quirky touches everywhere. We loved it! Would recommend this place to anyone coming to Melbourne. Thanks Dan for letting us stay at your place! "
76867,659135,2011-10-24,1240569,Mary,97,Judy made me feel welcome from the moment I arrived. We shared a meal and chatted late into the night like old friends. I felt quite relaxed after my stay which was just what I needed.  I recommend Judy's hospitality to women traveling alone as you will feel right at home. Thanks Judy.
10803,23901968,2014-12-14,10479127,Mary,99,"Lindsay let out a string of mandarin sentences the minute I stepped in and faced him. That was really cool and impressive! We hit it off on a good note. He also re-read my profile to find out my interests and gave me tips on where to go to get the better art and music exposure in Melbourne. It really helped that he lives so near to all these wonderful places. I loved the room and apartment; it was all eclectic and vibrant. When I arrived, he had already provided me with guidebooks to interesting places in Melbourne. Very helpful! He provided me with two towels (That was really important) and gifted me a newsletter of comics, which was really kind and sensitive of him as he seemed attuned to my interests. Lindsay's location, I would say, was the best. It was easy traveling from home to all the difference places in Brunswick, Fitzroy, city, St Kilda and to the airport!!! Lastly, the icing on the cake was when I was allowed to have a look at his working studio. My stay in Melbourne was great, no less. 

I look forward to staying with him again if I visit Melbourne again! And if Lindsay ever comes to Singapore, I'd be glad to show him around :) Thank you, Lindsay!"
108032,18833529,2014-09-01,173889,Mary,100,"Location! Location! Location!  If you want to experience Melbourne culture this is the place to be.  The studio is just as described: convenient, quiet yet just just a few steps from the restaurants and shops of Flinders Lane and Collins Street and the theatres and museums of Federation Square and Southbank.  Malcolm is very welcoming and helpful and lots of maps and brochures of attractions are provided.  We will definitely recommend to friends."
108032,705382,2011-11-09,1197509,Mary,99,"My host, Camilla, was immediate in replying to me and discrete in giving me space.  I'd be proud to own an apartment  as nice as Camilla's.  It's beautiful, airy, spacious, and so silent!  If you want somewhere to stay in Melbourne, look no further - this is it.  And, oh, the coffee and cakes right across the street were heaven.  You've got to try their home-made cakes.  Why would anyone ever choose to stay in a hotel when you can get such good accommodation and value for money with airbnb?  For less than I would pay for a cramped hotel room, I enjoyed a modern, bright, spacious apartment right in the center of Melbourne, Australia.  I visited Victoria Market and loaded up on fabulous food which I could cook for myself in the fully equipped apartment.  I booked holiday day tours which left from Federation Square, only a short walk away.  No problem getting up early to get the bus to the airport.  The location is just terrific."

The apartment is quiet and the windows look out on the surrounding trees and garden which is remarkable given that the apartment is located so close to the city and to the all the fabulous shops, restaurants, cafe's and bars of Fitzroy. It is easy to walk to the city but, also, there are trams (Gertrude St and Victoria Parade) a few minutes walk away that will take you to major galleries and other attractions in central Melbourne.  Rebecca replied to our communications promptly and check in and out was easy. We highly recommend Rebecca and her lovely apartment."

Reasonable cost accommodation, a clean and comfortable room with own bathroom and clean and well appointed communal kitchen and living areas.  A short tram ride to the CBD where  I was taking my course, and same to St Kilda. A brief walk to Albert Park lake for some exercise. The 'in house' caretaker was very helpful too when I had queries.

The location was great, however the apartment was tired and not cleaned properly.  There was mould in the showers, paint chips off most of the furniture, and the cushions and couches needed cleaning.  The TV did not work, although this was fixed partially on our stay and no wifi which was really annoying, and despite many phonecalls was not fixed.  This was most annoying for business people who needed it over the weekend, and unable to search out Melbourne hotspots."

Tania and Stephen are lovely hosts, and made me feel very welcome. The back deck and garden is an especially delightful space. The location is handy to CERES and the wonderful Lentil as Anything cafe, and the tram runs to the fabulous Brunswick St cafes. I will certainly stay again. "

Her architect designed apartment is luxurious, comfortable and tastefully adorned with interesting and eclectic artworks. It is located in very beautiful and peaceful surrounds, close to the Spirit of Tasmania wharf and a short tram ride to the Centre of Melbourne. There are many good restaurants nearby. Possibly one of the best of my many air bnb experiences."

307615,207263375,2017-10-28,46497544,Mathew,97,Sharyn made us feel very welcome in her home with her little dog. Sharyn is great to have a chat with about the local area and what's been happening and has done a great job with the space available in the old unit. The room was a great size for the weekend stay with a separate but private bathroom. Only downside was the occasional noise from the Laneway from locals or the rubbish truck but we just closed the window and it was minimal. My girlfriend and I had a great weekend there in such a central location.

We had the top level all for our selves (bedroom, bathroom and a small alcove), which offered privacy and comfort.

Ramona's a very friendly and welcoming host and she was quick to offer us loads of local tips for good restaurants and bars (of which there are many in Fitzroy and around), and even though we didn't have a lot of time to chat during our stay, she made us feel very welcome.

Definitely recommendable!"

The kitchen was great for cooking, and the deep bathtub was a favourite of mine :) thank you for such a lovely place to stay!"
51592,8154076,2013-10-18,3420403,Matt,80,"As soon as you walk in you remember why booking a private apartment on airbnb trumps a hotel, because this place oozes character that's hard to get and makes you feel at home. The layout and presentation of this apartment is fantastic, with lots of natural light and has huge open spaces, and I'm fairly sure this is the coolest zombie-proof apartment in the Melbourne CBD. 

The apartment is well decorated and has everything you should need, the kitchen is well equipped, the laundry facilities work well, the swing swings, etc, etc. I will return. "

Self check-in was very simple as we arrived in the early hours - and apart from a courtesy knock on the door the next day to check all was OK, we were left in complete privacy for the 3 day stay. Very clean, very cosy, and a few unexpected brekkie and fruit provisions were much appreciated. There's a couple of cafes 30 seconds away, next to an IGA which stocks all the basics.

The apartment is a nicely renovated warehouse that's comfortable, clean,  and well equipped.  

Hoang was a welcoming host and I'd certainly stay here again. Recommended."

Within a few blocks are a ton of great cafes, restaurants, pubs and bars, a great charcuterie/butcher, plus the 86 tram line is right there. It doesn't take very long to walk to Brunswick St or Lygon St, and we walked to the city a couple of times as well. 

The apartment itself is really comfortable and relaxing. You feel like a local in Melbourne straight away. The kitchen works well and the bed is comfortable. So glad we stayed there."

So many thoughtful touches I don‚Äôt even know where to begin with. 

I have to say my favourite was the selection of breads available. If it is there, definitely go for the Walnut and Honey loaf, my goodness that was a delicious treat!

Ramona was very welcoming and nothing was ever a fuss.
You‚Äôre basically in the heart of Melbourne, 15 mins from South Yarra/Toorak and about 10-20 from the main junction (depending on traffic).

I was fortunate enough to have a rental car and so Ramona was very accommodating to my needs with the visitor permit (make sure you double check before you check in).

Plenty of helpfully tips and tourist maps, but don‚Äôt worry about that as Ramona knows all the ‚Äúgo to‚Äù places to visit, especially around Fitzroy.

Definitely worth a stay, just make sure you‚Äôre quick as like the last pack of Tim Tams on sale, it‚Äôll go quickly.

Thank you Ramona for a wonderful stay, I shall look forward to staying again.
Matt."

The apartment is both spacious and cosy, and if you're a dog lover (which I am), Roger will melt your heart. He is easily the most laid back house dog I've ever met! Location-wise the apartment is ideal, as you are in walking distance from both the best of the CBD as well as all that inner city Fitzroy has to offer.

She hosted gracefully, welcoming us with a funny chat every time we came back home.
The apartment is quite big, clean and fair: nothing extraordinary but ideal for a quick stay to visit Melbourne.
The location is key being within the Grid, therefore very central and comfortable for all the activities.

Just up the road is our new favourite breakfast spot called The Fair Foodstore (cnr Church & Somerset Streets) which serves divine, fresh food and some of the best coffee in town!

A whole apartment walking distance to the city, convenient public transport options (train to the buzzing inner north, bus to the beaches, bus to countrytowns such as Warrendyte).

Lovely hosts, great location, and if I'm in need of another break from the city, I won't hesitate to stay again. Thanks!"

The only complaint is that the floor boards/ceiling are pretty thin and we were woken up at 6am on weekdays by movement upstairs. (Not during Weekends though). Would highly recommend this place apart from that one issue."

Fiona met me on my first day with amazing hospitality & her husband showed me around the village to get food & point out the best shops. The tram stops a block away. The train station is a 15 walk. So location is excellent to get anywhere without a vehicle. Any time I had questions, Fiona was immediately available to help. The apt is homey and comfortable with absolutely everything it needs for a great stay. I can't think of a more perfect place for a  base in Melbourne."

It's an authentic location I likely never would have discovered on my own as a tourist. Chris provided great advice on where the locals hang out and tourist traps to avoid; just what I was looking for. "
51592,7367374,2013-09-17,7557353,Maureen,0,Perfect location. Great to have such a large space. The apartment is not quite as nice as it seems from the photos - just a little bit tired.

As we come to Melbourne regularly to visit our children, we may use the apartment again. An extra chair would be useful as we like to have them have a meal or coffee with us at times. The apartment was clean and bright.

Danielle and Ruth communicated with us about our arrival, local information, where to find the key and provide a lively bottle of wine! "

I was excited to stay longer in this beautiful apt that is so well located for getting to the city and the beach. I loved the sunny living room & the cute kitchen. It felt like home. Any time I needed anything, Fiona responded immediately & was so helpful. If I can visit Melbourne again, I cross my fingers that her apt will be available."

She's the best host and the accommodation is perfection. She's thought of everything. Little touches to make your stay perfection, great tips for the neighbourhood, beautiful refresh service mid stay, gorgeous linens, and above all, the best hospitality going. We love Ramona and cannot recommend her place more highly."
317351,34626288,2015-06-10,29369409,Mauricio,97,"This was a great flat for our first month in Australia.

We had a very late checkin during the weekend, but this wasn't a problem for the hosts. 
On arrival there was a nice welcome pack for us, including coffee, tea, wine and cookies. We felt comfortable from the very beginning.

Amenities inside the flat were absolutely fantastic: small toys for our daughter, guide books/leaflets, CD and Bluray player (with selected movies), washing machine, etc.
You have everything you need, and more. I mean, EVERYTHING. It is really a ""Living Like Locals"" experience.

The flat was pretty clean, and is as spacious and bright as the pictures suggest.

The communication before and during our stay was excellent. 
Giuseppe was always very quick to respond and was very helpful.
Living in Melbourne was a challenge for us at first, but Giuseppe helped us a lot and made our lives easier.

The location of the flat is very good.
You only need a short walk to the coffee and shopping stores at Balaclava. The tram, bus and train are near enough to just go anywhere in Melbourne.

It was a great start to our lives in Australia. This unit is a good base for finding somewhere more permanent to live, and works very well for people with kids. We will definitively rent this unit for our family when they come to visit us.

We highly recommend ""Living Like Locals"" and wish the best to Giuseppe & CO. 

Thank you very much!"

We were able to be flexible during the day to enjoy our route to the property being Viktoria and Joseph flexible for check-in.
They accommodate our needs from a bed perspective by providing an additional room which wasn't part of the price paid.
The place is very clean,quiet and beds are very comfortable. Even if we didn't use the other space available the house has a big lounge room were we could read and watch TV within our private area.
The place is ideal for people who like to fish or want to enjoy both Phillip Island and Melbourne being half way of these two places.

Viktoria prepared breakfast for us even if it wasn't expected as part of the booking. We enjoyed talking to Joseph who made all efforts to accommodate our late check-out and provide useful tips.

Thank Viktoria and Joseph for having us, our stay was great!"

One thing I will mention is that the Wifi is a bit spotty and only really works in the living room area; having said that it does work consistently there. If that is super important to you it might be worth it to get a mobile wireless device. 

Other than that, the apartment comfortably fit my family of six and was within walking distance of plenty of restaurants and public transportation, and it was easy to catch a cab from there as well.

Thanks, Dina!"

323280,2075849,2012-08-23,2801509,Maxwell,100,"I booked this for a friend who was on exchange from Sweden. 

The house is clean and secure. 

The house operates under a set of environmentally-friendly measures that guests are expected to adhere to. These include only using the laundry facilities once a week, saving excess water from the shower, and limiting use of electric lights during daylight hours. 

Communication was good. 

Internet is $10 a week and this is not included in the Airbnb charge. You pay it to Fay on arrival in cash. My friend reported that the wifi worked well the whole time. 

Fridge space is limited so bear this in mind if you are considering arriving with a large amount of groceries at one time. "

it's really a good location to stay and convenience to walk around to town even by taking a tram or buses and the free shultle bus stop at location 13 (it just 8mins walk from here).
 
in terms of comparing prices to other rooms in town, it's so cheap and worth to stay. 

it's really like staying in a second house when u're alone travel in oversea. i felt so warm and has judy's company, we chat and wacthing TV during the night time n she's guiding n helping me to solve some of my problem while i was there.

it's definately a good place to recommend to others and worthy for price!

The communication in advance was amazing! I'm travelling a lot with airbnb, but I never had a host who was sending me so many great tips in advance and who was literally leaving no open questions at all. Additionally, Ramona was doing us a huge favor, by letting us send some documents to her, which we urgently needed while being in Australia.

The room itself is on the third floor and has a very nice private bathroom with daylight window. Everything was super clean and the organic shower gel & shampoo smelled great as well.

Ramona is a very lovely person and took care of us by providing some tasty breads and juices, as well as by always be up for a nice chat when being at home at the same time."
150729,25660490,2015-01-22,2003414,Melanie,92,Ramona was a fantastic host and her property is beautiful. The room was perfect with everything you need for a comfortable stay decorated with lovely extras making a charming space. My friend and I loved talking with Ramona about Melbourne and she was very helpful and organized. The property is in the perfect spot to explore Fitzroy and to access all the sights of the city. Highly recommend!!!
150729,193781300,2017-09-15,52812743,Melanie,97,"Such a lovely place to stay in, everything you need in one place, and within easy walking distance. Ramona is a fabulous person, and very welcoming!"
108032,2103595,2012-08-26,1310999,Melanie,98,"The studio was absolutely perfect. Although I didn't meet Malcom in person, everything run smoothly and the communication with him was excellent. I would definitively recommend staying there. "
280698,341414822,2018-10-26,25978324,Melanie,99,"What a great find!  So close to the hub of Elwood and St Kilda yet private and quiet down the private laneway.  Tram stop, bottle shop, cafe and restaurants literally on the doorstep, but with no noise whatsoever.  Huge space, well equipped and very comfortable beds and linen.  Frank and Vince were very quick with their responses, and flexible to try and help with a varied check in time.  I recommend this to any couple or 2 couples (easily accommodates 2 couples) who are looking for an inner city central location."
51592,15781324,2014-07-15,2258143,Melanie,98,"What a neat space- this was my first time using Airbnb, and this was just a tad more expensive than my conference hotel, so I decided to go for a stay in the city. I stayed a full week with my 20 yo son. At several points we had visitors over for a drink or cards and everyone was impressed with the space, all (adults!) took a try or two on the fun swing right in the middle of the room. The space just has a great feel, comfortable enough that we were not overly concerned with ruining anything and nice enough that we felt like we were having a neat city experience.  We felt welcomed by Michelle who was flexible with our check in and out time, and handed over her space kindly and with trust.

My favorite things:
1. Large gothic windows with great light
2. Comfortable couches, and a cozy mattress for the floor, also very comfortable large bed upstairs
3. Great gathering spaces- enough seating for a dinner around table or comfy couches for 6.
4. in the center of everything- right in the middle of the city, easy access to public transport, the Vic market, lots of close eateries, the mall, Chinatown
5. Lots of local books about the city in the loft (the hostess herself is a travel author)
6. Michelle provided great supplies, including shampoo, laundry soap, some spices and instant coffee- all the basics to get us by- and the kitchen was well stocked so we could cook up the things we brought back from the Vic Market
7. Reliable wi-fi internet service, and an hdmi cable so we could watch movies from our laptop

Things you should know to plan a pleasant visit:
1. There's not much privacy. The only door in the place is on the small toilet closet. The shower/bath combo does not have a door and the bath area is visible from several places in the loft.
2. This is not a place for kids. It's a third floor apartment and there are not rails on the stairs within the loft. There are not steps down in to the tub, and the roof access is a bit of a sharp climb- so not a place for anyone with limited mobility.
3. There's really no nearby long-term parking, and it's pricey to park in the city.
4. This is in the city and there are lots of city noises. There's a great clock that chimes on the hour and the half. The alleyway starts ""waking up"" at about 7am, with warm light through the windows and openings of local businesses. The loft shares a stairway with a tattoo shop and you can hear people up and down the stairs through the day and evening.

No complaints from me, I'd stay again, or at any other property managed by this nice hostess. It will be hard to top this experience. Thanks Michelle!"

Its proximity to the CBD, sporting arenas and the Yarra River make it a great place to stay if visiting Melbourne for a short period. The home is well equipped to ensure self-catering is a viable option. However, the noise from Punt Road and light from a  nearby apartment meant that ear plugs and eye masks were required for a light sleeper like myself."

Lulu and Michael were the most brilliant hosts. From the lovely fruit bowl and wine on arrival, nothing was ever too much trouble. Both responded quickly to our texts, gave great local foodie hints and shopping tips and ensured that we were comfortable during our stay.

A hop away from both bus and tram options, a skip to fabulous shopping opportunities and a jump to the delectable restaurants and cafes ‚Äì we couldn‚Äôt have asked for a better location in the heart of Fitzroy.

Located down a quiet, one way lane, the studio itself was a great little escape from those lively streets. With a really cool modern retro vibe, the studio was roomy and fully equipped with all the necessities for our 10 day stay. The outdoor garden area was a great quirky place to put our feet up too with a coldie and wind down after a full day experiencing all that the area has to offer.

Thank you Lulu and Michael for a wonderful place to stay. It was so lovely to meet you both and we will most definitely be back!!

We felt immediately at ease and comfortable in her FANTASTIC space.  Incredibly well situated, with all the comforts of home.  A great base to explore and walk the Melbourne CBD...with trams at doorstep to take you further (eg: St. Kilda, Lululemon outlet :)), etc!!  Our 4-year-old son was delighted with the bed that pulled out of the wall! A highlight of his trip.  Thanks Camilla...  "

72576,22426230,2014-11-06,18798216,Melinda,99,"Ramona provided little touches such as parking permit, Myki cards etc and the room was nicely set up with a nice bathroom. We didn't feel particularly safe in the area - surrounded by high rise public housing but it was convenient to Gertrude Street & the tram. The bedroom also backs directly on to 4 different back garden/terraces so if there are people there you hear them, as well as noise from other neighbours across the road. We didn't meet Ramona at all - didn't really need to but at the same time thought it was odd. Breakfast was not provided for my partner who doesn't eat bread & there was mould on the dark bathroom tiles. It's a pretty cool apartment but personally we would try somewhere different next time."

310594,343800860,2018-11-01,5962942,Melissa,100,"I was trying to stay in Fitzroy/Collingwood but kind of fell in love with the pictures showing all of the windows in Bridget's place. At first I was worried that it would be too far away from the neighborhoods I was interested in exploring, but Abbotsford is pretty cool in its own right and I enjoyed my walks on different streets to and from Fitzroy. There are some great cafes right around the corner and I really liked visiting the Convent, so all in all very happy I stayed here.

It is Bridget's place, so there are touches of her all around, which I appreciate. I am the type of Airbnb person who prefers the eclectic and enjoys staying in people's homes. If you are too, you will like it here. It is compact but has everything you need and is a comfortable spot to just hang out, if you don't feel like going anywhere or doing anything. The bed is very comfortable. Water pressure in the shower is great. She is easy to communicate with and very accommodating. Will stay here again if I'm back this way, for sure."

You're not going to find a much better location. The apartment itself is delightfully quirky with a blend of modern while retaining some of the features of the original warehouse. The view from the rooftop is quite beautiful and coupled with the smell of honey from the bees on the upper level. Michelle is approachable and very prompt to respond to any correspondence. I've already recommended this stay to everyone I've spoken to. Thanks!"

Having a separate ensuite was also very convenient, as it means there are no worries about waiting for the bathroom. Lots of room in the wardrobe, too.

Mario was good to deal with, and didn't mind it when I'd come back from a fairly late night out. "

10803,333891142,2018-10-07,32372254,Melissa Ann,0,"I stayed in Lindsay's space for one month - We didn't see much of each other, both being busy and consistently on the go, or retreating to our rooms to wind down, though when we did cross paths (usually in the kitchen), Lindsay was friendly, warm, and helpful. 
The location is great; there are two caf√©s right downstairs (one has vegan friendly food options), also there is a pizza place right downstairs as well if that's your jam, nomnomnom; about a 7 minute walk west on Blyth there is Merri Creek bike/walk/running path which is beautiful; if you go east on Blyth towards Lygon and Sydney, you end up in the heart of Brunswick - Tons of restaurants on Lygon, all within walking distance, and an IGA Express if you need little groceries - If you keep going to Sydney road (a bit more of a walk) and go south, more restaurants, more caf√©s, better grocery stores, some OP shops, and Barkly Square with a K-Mart, Coles, and other little stores; if you take the tram north (stop right in front of Lindsay's) you are brought right into the CBD where there are restaurants and shopping galore. Lindsay is very helpful if you have any questions! 
I also brought my own bicycle from Canada, and was able to lock it up out back without worry as there is a solid gate. 
*As mentioned in the listing*, the space is on a busy street so if noise bothers you, do bring ear plugs. I was totally fine, but a light/fussy sleeper would notice this, especially with a pub right in front. 
Thanks again, Lindsay! It was a pleasure!"

He treated me to an Italian breakfast on my second day and accompanied me to check out parts of Melbourne on a Sunday! Mario also became my part-time photographer and took some shots of me around the city. I really appreciated that as I have less selfies which don't really show the place I've been to, only my face. :P 

The room with ensuite was perfect for me too! Mario never intruded on my privacy. Being a super host that he is, he checked in on me regularly to see if I was alright. Mario also shared some good stories which I will remember for a long time. 

So if you ever find yourself planning a visit to Melbourne, I highly recommend staying at Mario's! "

made for a very easy introduction. 

The room is spacious and very comfortable, looking out  into the garden. The location is excellent with numerous public transport options within easy reach. "

Ramona was super generous with her time and energy, including reaching out via text to make sure I had all of the right information, giving advice about the best way to make it from the airport, and being a lovely host. We didn't overlap much, and I would have loved to chat more with her, and go get a pint nearby, but I'll have to save that for the next time I visit Melbourne. The time I did spend chatting with her was excellent, of course.

The space is lovely, quiet, with excellent intriguing decor, charming, functional, and welcoming. I'll totally be considering this as my first choice to stay the next time I come back."

They not only gave me maps of where to go in Melbourne but made great suggestions of what to do and even introduced me to new friends. Their cooking, conversation and guitar playing was to die for. I not only got a great deal on a room, I made new lifetime friends. 

Thank you!

The only thing I would warn you for is that the apartment is located very centrally, near two main roads. This has obvious advantages, but also comes with quite a lot of traffic noise. Personally I wasn't bothered by it (hence the five-star rating) but you might want to look for another place if you are very sensitive to noise."

It is well equipped, warm and cozy in winter, very quiet even though in close proximity to other units, good bed and quality cotton linen, easy access to public transport, 15 min walk to the CBD, lovely parks nearby, lots of shops and restaurants nearby, an ethnically and socially diverse demographic which I personally loved. The hot water service is small which does encourage water saving! The furniture is charmingly retro and my only minor suggestion is that it could benefit from a more comfortable couch. Rebecca was quick to respond to a couple of queries I had during my stay. Would happily stay here again."

Ramona has thought of so many small details that really make a difference - local eating recommendations never failed, and her list of things to do was very helpful.  The house itself is delightful - I was extremely comfortable throughout - and Ramona's hospitality is first class.  Thanks, Ramona, for a fantastic stay."

John was very respectful of my privacy and was always very polite and considerate.  John's place is outside of the city but very close to public transportation including the train line about 5 minutes away and a bus stop directly across the street. I would highly recommend staying here if you want to be a bit outside of the city and enjoy the peace and quiet of the suburbs but still want to access the city easily. "

Highly recommend. "
47100,7928686,2013-10-08,2276694,Michael,94,"Loved it!!! Honestly, perfect location, perfect host, perfect room, everything was perfect! 

Loren made sure we had everything we needed, and gave us the perfect tips on where to go and what to see. She's an amazing person, and we loved getting the chance to talk with her over a bottle of wine. Count yourself lucky if she can spare a minute or two while you're there.

As for the room, it's exactly as advertised. Plenty of parking right out front, easy access to the tram lines, walking distance to everything, and really close to an awesome breakfast spot, Gypsy & Mosquito! Eating there is like the perfect extension of the hipster decor in Loren's place, so it's a must. 

Anyway, if the rooms available, take it, you won't regret it!!!"

The home is cozy and well-stocked if you want to cook while you're there -- though with the location you can eat out every night. The beds are comfortable, too.

The check in and check out experience was seamless and communication with Mario prior to my arrival was fantastic. 

Mario is very friendly, it's shame that I had such a busy schedule that I couldn't spend more time in the apartment. It was my first Airbnb experience and i was deeply impressed with my stay with Mario. Would love to return in the near future. "

This home was outstandingly amazing , you can't stop looking at her unique collections of artifacts from around the world displayed on and around her stunning home.

Her placer art combined with her interesting taste, her welcoming gracious warm attitude was overwhelming.  This is a fabulous B&B in every respect , incredibly clean comfortable, first class linen and plenty of beautiful pillows which was so comfortable, i really did not want to get out of bed.

I am strongly recommending this place, in fact I have already told my friends who travel to Melbourne that they must stay here. The position of the residence was in walking distance to all shops and top hair dressing salons including Strugnell Cole in Bay Street."

Allans place is very clean, very brightly lit and the layout well planned. Large flatscreen tele, new and matching crockery, new fridge - I felt like I was staying in a brand new place which points to the level of care and maintenance Allan puts into his place. My visitors, two different sets and locals were impressed by the place too. Will not hesitate recommending a stay at Allans. "

No dining room table, except on the terrace (which is small but nice). Host had many of his things there (furnishings, clothes, etc) but it was not a hindrance. 

The best shower I've ever experienced in my life!

Host was very easy to work with.

One note: VERY hard to find this place the first time. You go down the street to the very, very end -- the street curves around to the left at the end at then dead ends) and the apartment building is then the one directly on your RIGHT. The mailboxes are on the reverse of the freestanding structure with the building address on it. Once you enter the building, the door immediately on the right takes you directly into the underground carpark -- very convenient!"

It's shard but you have plenty of privacy with the tip floor all to yourself. Ramona is a perfect host, and has thought of every detail, from a hot water bottle on the bed (great for winter), to good tips on where to go eat locally.

313648,986212,2012-03-10,1368297,Michael,93,"This is an excellent apartment and Haydn and Katrina are very thoughtful hosts. The apartment is just east of Fitzroy Gardens, so not in the CBD, but pretty close. It has its own free parking, too (a tight squeeze, so if you‚Äôre a bad driver or have a huge vehicle, be aware).

Haydn and Katrina renovated and stocked this apartment strictly for guests (they live a few minutes away), and they‚Äôve given careful thought to what visiting guests may need. There‚Äôs a bedroom, a living room, a kitchen and a bathroom, as well as a washer/dryer. The whole place is very clean. Since they don‚Äôt live there, you‚Äôre not ‚Äúliving with other people‚Äôs stuff‚Äù (which I liked), yet they‚Äôve tried to make the place stylish and homey.

They‚Äôre also very thoughtful hosts: they were very flexible on check-in and out times, and when we accidentally locked ourselves out, Katrina popped by a few minutes later to let us in.

Also, if you need transportation to/from the airport, the local Skybus can pick you up or drop you off 2 minutes away (ask Haydn for details).

I would definitely recommend this place ‚Äì very good experience all around.

One caveat: I think we were the first people to stay here, and there was no internet installed at the time, but I think there may in the future (possibly by the time you‚Äôre reading this), so be aware. We bought a prepaid Wi-Fi setup from a nearby Telstra store for $100 and it worked perfectly (as long as you‚Äôre not doing any major downloading, which would get very costly). There‚Äôs also free Wi-Fi available at the public library 2 minutes away during daytime hours.

Mia was extremely friendly and helpful before and during our stay. We tried many of her suggestions for local bars and restaurants and they were all great.  Mia's apartment was exactly as listed, extremely clean and comfortable for our five night stay. It had everything we needed plus some thoughtful extras. The apartment is less than 5 mins walk from South Yarra train station, from there it is two stops into the CBD - the train is the City Loop which takes you pretty close to most parts of the CBD from Parliament to Docklands. There are also nearby trams.  We would happily recommend Mia and her apartment to anyone visiting Melbourne and especially if you want to stay outside the CBD in the exciting and vibrant South Yarra.

Good location close to the city and to the free tram and bus routes. Fitzroy is  a good place to be based as it has it's own identity with lots of places to eat and close to Lygon street Italian quarter. Although we did not meet Rebecca regular communication was good before we arrived and her neighbour Robert was very helpful in settling us in. Pity we were not around for the F1 or a match at MCG. Will have to return to the tree house.
51592,363492578,2018-12-28,118486039,Michael,90,"What a FANTASTIC place and location. Having lived in Melbourne previously and stayed in many accommodations, this is by far the best if you really want to get the feel of living/staying in Melbourne. The location is perfect and the BEST coffee on the corner of the laneway and street front. The night view of the post office and office building from the big arch windows, immediately reminded me of when and where we stayed in New York with the view and lighting at the top of the Empire State Building. We will definately be back to stay. Thank you Michelle you were also the perfect host."

There were some definite hits on the tour in Harajuku, with one of them being so beautiful I had to snap a photo myself and make it my phone wallpaper. I recommend her to anyone looking for some hidden gems in Harajuku, great conversation, or just a fun time in general."

Kitchen facilities (should one tire of the local cafe scene - ha!) fab goodies from Fatto a Mano, DVD library, all sorts of great collectables; we didn't want to leave. The real treasure, however, is Ramona herself. Friendly whilst also allowing guests their own space, and oh-so knowledgeable about her fantastic neighborhood. She has everything well organized for guests....go and stay."

Place is clean and as described. A couple of issues with keys and an electronic access scanner that didn't work but sorted out easily enough. A handy crash pad close to lots of restaurants, bars and the casino. Sofa beds were pretty thin and one could hold a persons body weight which meant it had to be moved to the floor. Overall a good place to use as a crash pad and decent value for money. "

The location is great- away from traffic (but close to public transport) and in a funky area. I noticed noise from upstairs in the morning- but my companions didn't- if you're a light sleeper and want a sleep in take ear plugs. 

Kitchen and bathroom were both spotless with modern appliances. 

We would definitely stay here again.

The apartment was nice and tidy and an ideal place to stay while I was on my business trip. I could walk to all meetings in the CBD. Having the Aldi supermarket downstairs was great too. Very good experience and I would recommend Mario's without hesitation!

Her place, which offers everything and is really more then lovely is located in Fitzroy, a part of Melbourne which offers a full variety of brilliant bars, restaurants and shops. I really loved this area and something which might be important for some of you, I felt always really safe.
Ramona was a lovely, warm host who offered any help needed and who made me feel at home.
I highly recommend her place, if I‚Äôll ever be back in Melbourne I would always stay with her again.

The apartment is just so luxe, right down to the little details. Mia was a friendly host and was around to give us a full tour of her abode! The cafe downstairs had the most delicious food, South Yarra station was just a stone throw away and the view from her apartment was lovely :) A perfect weekend, thank you Mia for everything!"

78143,10061590,2014-01-28,8947612,Michele,90,"A gorgeous home away from home. We were a family of two young boys who were happy to share the second bedroom double bed but if you have preference for two single beds, then this won't suit. The master room has a queen bed and the pillow were the most comfortable I have ever slept on other than my own!!  There is a TV in this room only. Also, lots of Melbourne pamphlets and Julie is a local with lots of knowledge about the region.  She was very kind to stay up late when we were arrived after 11pm.  Yummy healthy breakfast cereals are provided but we bought bread and jams, juices etc and were welcome to use appliances and oven. The bedroom curtains are sheer with venetian blinds so I'd suggest an eye patch if you are photo-sensitive while sleeping. 
Don't pack heavy bags as it is a flight of stairs up to the rooms and bathroom. The shower is strong and two basins plus a separate toilet makes for multiple usage if needed by all in the family. 

Julie has two little white Maltese dogs which are like dolls, do not bark or scratch or lick - just sit around and enjoy a cuddle.

The neighbourhood is quiet even though is part of a 70 unit strata complex.  Parking is only onstreet and Julie gives you a permit.  There are sometimes few spaces available in front but the furtherest distance we had to walk was only one block. 

There are quality Thai, Japanese/Vietnamese restaurants and lots of Tapas bars in Chapel St. The corner hotel 'college lawn' is stylish and excellent meals with many TVs and nice clientelle. 

We didn't try the pool in the complex, but it looked very enticing.

Highly recommended for groups or families with sensible and quiet children.

We were very comfortable, warm and looked after. Breakfast offerings of locally baked bread and fresh orange juice gave us a good start when we eventually got up. Gloria walked us up to Lygon street for a great dinner and refreshed our memory of local offerings. Highly recommend a stay with Gloria in Parkville"

The home was as depicted, though smaller than I had anticipated (and that it appeared in the photos). The fold-out sofa was comfortable for my daughter, though having the sole bathroom accessible via the sole bedroom makes the apartment most suitable for someone single or a couple. When there were small issues to be addressed, the hosts were responsive and prompt. The neighbourhood is excellent: hugely convenient for someone visiting Melbourne who likes to explore food and wonderful walking streets."

I also recommend Doncaster Shopping Town - WOW."

The room was very comfortable and is in a nice quiet street. The location was great for us as we had a Christening in Williamstown with the function afterwards in Newport. We really only were at the house to sleep that night, but would have definitely liked to stay longer if we had the time. "

I'm happy to have made friends with Linda and Buddy and this is more than just a stay.

The apartment was above and beyond what we were expecting. The pictures are a great representation of the apartment on the inside but don't show how amazing the location is. This apartment is truly nestled in the heart of Melbourne CBD. Everything is a very short walk away including public transportation, great restaurants, cafes, grocery store, etc...
My fiance and I recently moved to Melbourne and we used Eliisa's apartment as a temporary place to stay while we found our permanent place in St. Kilda. We wanted the city experience before finding a permanent place a bit away from the city. Eliisa's apartment definitely gave us the city experience we wanted. "

Place was clean and Neil was very accommodating re: check in and check out times.

The location was good too. . .just two blocks from Victoria Market and a few more to public transportation.

Judy's hospitality was also wonderful - it was no trouble if we came and went as we pleased, or if we hung around for a chat over a glass of wine!

43429,2390301,2012-09-24,2946375,Michelle,93,"This is an amazing place to stay! To start Allan and Liz are amazing hosts, who only want you to have the best possible stay with them. The house property is beautiful and extremely well kept. The garden and decking next to apartment is beautiful and amazing to look at each day from the window. We were often asked to use any herbs in the garden and to make it our own. Just outside the front undercover door is more decking, but a BBQ that again we were encouraged  to use. The completely detached apartment is accessed by a gated side entrance and the apartment itself is very insulated. We never heard anything from the house and they never heard anything from us. The apartment itself was amazing and even better then the pictures show. Not only does it have everything you need, it has been designed and constructed in such a way that the space works fantastically and everything is used efficiently. The apartment had a full kitchen with oven, hotplates, microwave, kettle, toaster and fridge. It looks small on the photos, but again, it is so well done in where everything is situated that it feels like a full sized kitchen. The shower is lovely and big with a great shower head. I could of lost alot of time in the shower. Next to that is a washing machine, which we did use and was very happy it was there. Again the bathroom area looks small, but the way the space is used, makes it feel larger. The bedroom overlooking the rest of the apartment is large, but as it is all open, really opens everything up. The cupboard space was huge and great to hide our suitcases in and hang up anything we needed. The bed was very comfortable and big enough for both of us.  The living room area has a lovely large flat screen tv and very comfortable leather chairs. We easily sat here all night watching the tv. There is also a desk and chair that we used as a computer desk with some magazines and tourist information. Along with the desk, there is also a bookcase full of books! Always great to be able to grab and book to borrow while relaxing. The entire apartment is heated/cooled by one spilt system unit, but it does an amazing job. It heated the entire place in only a couple of minutes and we never had to have it on long. Overall, my husband and I were ready to move into this apartment. We felt completely at home and was relaxed in moments. It is bright and fresh and extremely well kept and clean. We were brought clean sheets, towels and tea towels often. There is public transport so close and we even walked to Chadstone. When we are next in Melbourne, this is the 1st place we will look for to stay, as it was very hard to leave. Thank you again Allan and Liz! "

Charming space, very clean and comfortable and the location is so good with the cottage being in a dead street but so close to bars and restaurants of Collingwood and Fitzroy. I'll certainly be staying again. Thanks Alan."

41836,973157,2012-03-05,38565,Miguel,95,If you want a good location and a feeling of being at home this is the place.  We shared the house with Diana's parents and they were adorable.  We got home made dumplings and her mum was nice enough to offer us breakfast every morning.  If you want a soft bed make sure you ask for it in your reservation since  Diana and her parents like to sleep on really firm beds. We got the soft mattress during our stay. Overall we had a wonderful stay and look forward to staying there again.

Mi avi√≥n aterrizaba en Melbourne a las 5:30 y tuvo el detalle de esperarme y permitirme hacer el check-in a esa hora cuando la hora establecida era las 3:00pm. Todo un detallado.
Durante mi estancia me he sentido como en mi propia casa.
La habitaci√≥n y el ba√±o perfectos. La Habitaci√≥n con cama grande y muy c√≥moda. Dispon√≠a tambi√©n de TV. 
Enfrente de la casa para el tranv√≠a 55 que te deja en 10 minutos en el centro. Y a 3 minutos andando puedes coger otros tranv√≠as."

The city is a walk but the trendy areas of Fitzroy and Collingwood  are close by and offer an abundance of  great quirky restaurants. Ramona is a great hostess and her property is really interesting. She is a keen antique collector and all the items she has collected over the years are on display. Very interesting and some quite bizarre! The bedroom is a good size with a balcony, and the shared kitchen is enormous with a great outdoor area with trees and shrubs around the table. A good selection of organic coffee, tea and breads for breakfast. Thoroughly recommended."

The apartment is in a good location in South Melbourne very close to the tram system.  We like to walk, so we walked to downtown a couple of times. 

Judy has a very nice apartment and the bedroom we used was very comfortable. The bed was very good and I say that as someone with lower back issues. She provided everything you would need for a comfortable stay, including breakfast.

Judy is very pleasant and was very helpful in guiding us to various sites of interest. We truly enjoyed staying with her and would highly recommend her apartment."
38271,40980937,2015-08-03,38217588,Mike,86,"We would highly recommend Old Trafford to anyone. It was our family's first AirBnB trip and we were extremely impressed with Daryl & Deanna's place, most importantly, the friendliness and open communication. The place was as described in the photos. Very clean, simple and quiet. We rented a car from the airport and it took us about 1 hour to get to Berwick. Staying in Berwick allowed us to easily explore Melbourne without getting stuck in heavy traffic and being limited to a small space. Definitely consider staying here if you come to Melbourne and want to get away from the hustle and bustle of the CBD and inner suburbs or if you have a rental car."

I will definitely recommend this to everyone who comes to SF, and wants to learn more about photography. 
And personally I want to attend more of Jerry's workshops to learn more and become a better photographer. "

Ramona promptly responded to my (many) questions and provided local tips/insights regarding the local area and transportation options. From check-in to check-out, the process was very easy. The home was as described  with a very comfortable bed, plus there were a number of special touches (local maps/guides) and stylish. I highly recommend Ramona home to other travelers."

Provides yummy breakfast, a cozy bed, and guidebooks and tips for those, like me, who wandered into town not knowing exactly what and where to explore. "

Her home made bread was delicious.  A tram stop for the tram no. 58 was right out of her door step, which took me South Yarra Village and the city. Overall, it was a comfortable stay. "
74548,30688046,2015-04-26,28935825,Min,87,"I had the best week!!!!, staying at Mario's place. First AirBnb experience and Mario is one of the most funtastic hosts I'd imagine I'd meet hands down -- super easy to get along with, always up for a good chat but allowed me the privacy I needed to chill out. We had a cook out night too, over a reality TV show that was accompanied by many laughs.

Facilities wise, it had everything and were all really clean & well presented. I was pleasantly surprised on first entry that the room had an ensuite (yay!). Wireless internet connectivity was great, went to the spa & gym several times during the week. Bluetooth speakers were fab to listen to a few hip hop beats, and the balcony was lined with fake grass which enhanced the ambiance -- played the flute several times. Mario also left some fridge space which I also appreciated and fully utilised.

Location wise, the apartment is on the more serene, less overcrowded & more safe side of the CBD, edging Carlton, and was close to a tram stop on Swanston that was just outside the free tram zone, or you can go to Elizabeth street stop which is in the free zone. Very handy. I worked at Collins st in the week and it was a nice and close enough walk into the CBD. Asian grocery store at the end of the street and an Aldi right downstairs, not to mention all the dining options on Elizabeth st, super convenient. Staying for the past week has made me fall in love with the location, would definitely recommend and come back again!

Thanks Mario, you're the best!!"

Location: Sharyn's place has excellent location! Right in the middle of Melbourne CBD. Close to shopping centers, train station, Queen Victoria Market, Collins Street, Rod Laver Arena...basically everything!
Apartment: Very cozy just like the pictures show:
Host: Sharyn is a SUPER NICE host! She gave me and my friend a lot of great advice. Really made like feel like home. And Roger is probable the cutest dog I've ever seen!"

In apartment, the security will make you feel safe and you can totally relax in your own room. An en suite bathroom is also clean, if there's a problem he will handle it right away. I would like to stay here again if I get a chance to. Thanks a lot for making such a good memory :)"
244952,10612786,2014-02-27,8165676,Mindy,100,"Despite making a very last minute request to book accommodation (same day as travel) and the fact that she was away herself, Rebecca's friendly response was almost immediate, and the booking process was very smooth, I can't recommend Rebecca highly enough as a host.
The apartment was clean, comfortable and quiet and lives up to its name as the treehouse, with the city view filtered by a magnificent gum, while a large fig drapes itself over the balcony entrance.
The apartment couldn't be more conveniently located, and while there is a choice of trams within a minutes walk either end of the street, the apartment is an easy walk to the city.
If you wish to stay local, the surrounding area, comprising Brunswick, Gertrude and Smith streets is a vibrant, energetic and abundant blend of eateries, shops and galleries.
In short, I recommend the treehouse apartment highly and look forward to staying again soon.
Thanks Rebecca

The bed is very comfortable and the level of cleanliness everywhere in the house is excellent. Having the back garden right outside the room was also a plus. The garage hang-out area was a feature that attracted us to the place, but wasn't as idyllic as painted in the description- there was clutter in there at the time, but that seemed to be temporary. Northcote is such a great neighbourhood, with so many great places to check out just on High St itself! As an antedote to $4 coffees up in High St zone, the 7/11 just across from Walter and Amanda's has coffee for $1 which is really quite good. We'd stay with these guys again, and next time we'd bring bicycles (as we discovered it's the best way to get around in Melbourne)."

She was a perfect host; making us feel welcome and taking an interest in our itinerary, yet encouraging us to get out and see Melbourne! She went above and beyond for us - recommending must see places, offering her wisdom on anything we asked, and even booking in a reservation at a highly-sought after restaurant, when we ourselves couldn't secure a booking. 
Her personality aside, the accommodation was absolutely charming. The place is filled with welcoming natural light, has its own unique decor, and has every thing you could ever need. I had a better sleep at Ramona's then I do in my own bed! 
The location of house ended up being perfect for us too - located in probably the more artsy district of Melbourne, we were surrounded by fantastic shopping (including op-shops), bars, and amazing eateries. 
Although only staying with her for three nights, I feel like I know Ramona quite well and would highly recommend any one stay with her. I wouldn't even consider staying anywhere else for my future Melbourne trips."

It is like one of those experiences that you cannot explain and you have to be in that situation to understand it. The house was such beautiffully decorated that with all honesty it worths to just treat it as a small and warm contemporary museum.
Loved and enjoyed the stay so much and will not look at any other places to stay in Melbourne. :)

It has everything you would need so for that you can prepare your meal, coffee and tea. Also, you can wash clothes. So sit back and relax! 
I came to Mel for school so the small study area help in finding a space to study and do homework. 
The location is super and accessible to everywhere in Melbourne. Trains, trams and buses are just around the corner. Additionally, the building very close to the best restaurants and coffee shops in Mel. It is close to shopping centres as well. Basically, you are in the heart of Melbourne. Eliisa is a friendly, nice and helpful person.  We felt that we are staying at friend's home.  She provided us with some good advice before arrival. Check-in and check-out was easy. In short, great experience in all aspects. "

50492,24182546,2014-12-22,11434684,Moira,90,Frank and Vince were fantastic at communication and the flat had everything we needed. St Kilda is such a great place with bars and caf√©s on our doorstep. We fell in love with the second hand bookshop round the corner. And I fulfilled my dream of having an early morning swim on my birthday - the longest day in Australia rather than the shortest day as it would've been back home.

It couldn't be in a more central location: right in the heart of the CBD, within walking distance of the train station, offices (if you're working) and all the best restaurants and bars. It was exactly as depicted. Great style, great light, fun design. Only thing you should be aware of is that they expect you to clean the apartment thoroughly and wash all the linens and remake the bed before you leave. Make sure you have time to do that, or let them know in advance!"

They are super easy going and made us feel at home right away. It's clear that they have had a lot of house guests but still left nice little extras like cherry bath soap and pamphlets in our room. 

We stayed in one of their double rooms, which was quite spacious. You could just melt into the bed it was so comfy. They also have super fast wifi and the room even had a wireline connection too.

They're located with in a short walking distance to the Newport train station. We found it very easy to get around Melbourne from their home.

We found nice restaurants and coffeehouses nearby. There is plenty of roadside parking around the apartment. We hope we will meet Loren and Ruth next time when we're in Melbourne.

Breakfast is amazing ( the best muffins we had in Australia), living area is huge and gorgeous!

Well Ramona's home exceeded every expectation by leaps and bounds! Ramona was a wonderful host and really made us feel right at home. She gave us great tips for things to do in town and made some great recommendations to our itinerary (12 days!) and somehow she manages to keep her home spotless! Each day we woke up to DELICIOUS organic muffins and breads and were close by to a dizzying array of boutique shops, nightlife, delicious restaurants and cafes and plenty of other cozy little assortments in Fitzroy. When we didn't feel like going out after a long day of exploring, we were able to cook up a delicious meal with goods from nearby stores and markets with a wonderfully laid out kitchen. Ramona is just a 10 minute walk to the CBD, although you may not even need to venture that far with all that Fitzroy has to offer! This location truly has it all: clean, comfortable, convenient, and a very sweet and caring host! I cannot recommend Ramona's place enough - book now, you won't be disappointed! "

Fitzroy itself was a perfect neighborhood for us, providing plenty of local attractions in the many cafes, bars, art galleries, and shops as well as easy access to the CBD, Carlton, and other areas. We cannot recommend Ramona and her home enough. Next time we are in Melbourne, this will definitely be where we stay. "

150729,5436288,2013-06-30,1320755,Mothla,90,"We had a fantastic time staying at Ramona's. The room is private, warm, and Ramona has thought of everything -- right down to bath robes, welcome chocolate, and maps and cards of all of her favourite places in the city.

The house itself is just as wonderful -- full of light, warmth, and interesting bits that Ramona has collected. It's obvious that she has put a lot of thought and heart into her home, which makes her sharing it all the more special. The breads and muffins from the bakery she works at are a real treat in the morning -- thanks Ramona!

Gertrude Street is a wonderful spot to be based in Melbourne. We've visited the city a few times, and definitely find that it's one of our favourite areas. Lots of great shops, caf√©s, bars, restaurants, and so on.

We would thoroughly recommend staying with Ramona -- and look forward to the next time that we can! Thanks so much Ramona -- you made our short holiday in Melbourne very special."

The kitchen is fully equipped and renovated, and the apartment in general has been appointed with modern, functional furniture. The building and area are very quiet, and very close to trams, train station and walking distance to shopping/cafe/restaurant areas. Beautiful Fitzroy Gardens is 3 minutes away on foot. I loved staying here.

Haydn was very responsive all at times, answering all my emails and questions in a timely manner. He was even nice enough to let me put my bags in the apartment before check-in time, since I had been flying for many hours prior to reaching Melbourne and arrived early in the morning. We initially had an issue with the way the apartment was left by the cleaning crew, but Haydn and Katrina called and emergency cleaning crew after business hours the same day, and both of them came by to personally supervise that everything was done right. They really took responsibility for this aspect of the service. 

In the end, the apartment was delivered in very clean condition and my stay was great.

Katrina was also very kind to deliver extra sheets and a bathroom mat as soon as I requested it."

Richmond is a terrific location and Loren and Ruth are fun hosts -- warm, charming and friendly; I felt instantly welcome and completely at ease as if we had always been roomies. For a first time air bnb-er, this was a great comfort. The apartment and private room is brimming with personality and really feels like a home away from home. Thanks to Loren's directions I had complete confidence getting around and her great suggestions meant I was able to discover parts of Melbourne I had never visited before.

His house is a hidden treasure - beautifully decorated, totally quiet, perfectly situated between Smith and Brunswick Streets in the best part of Melbourne, with plenty of FREE PARKING. Alan is a thoughtful and engaging retired professional man whose company I enjoyed immensely. His home baked bread and marmalade is irresistible, and everything is centred on his cozy fire, (but you'll have to negotiate a fireside location with Amy). Funky shops, eateries, and transport are only a few minutes walk away. I cannot think of a better Melbourne accommodation option."

The apartment had all appliances you would image and more - felt like a home from home with Apple TV and Nespresso machine.  Oscar also had milk for us on arrival, which after a 14 hour flight was greatly appreciated. 

Large balcony was a bonus and a secure car park which allowed us to hire a car and not have to pay for parking.

Loren and Ruth were the perfect hosts, very easy to get along with and great communicators. We were even welcomed with fresh baked scones! Yum! Their place is very charming, beautifully decorated, warm and cosy. The bed is comfortable and warm enough for a Melbourne winter, and the room is quite spacious. If in future I plan to go to Melbourne, I will try to stay with these two indefinitely!"

Her place is quite a distance from the city, but there's a bus stop just outside the door. Catch that bus to the station and off you go to the city. No big deal. If you're looking for a homely place to stay while at Melbourne, this is definitely the place."

Parkdale was such a nice place, Beach was just 10 mins walk and Train station was less than 5 mins from Babara's home. People in Parkdale were really kind.  It is little far from City but zone1 and zone1&2 fare are same, so it is worth to take a 15 mins more train and get a totaly safty and quiet accomodation with kind English Woman. I love Barbara!

Ramona herself is very kind, sweet and approachable. I would absolutely recommend anyone visiting Melbourne to stay at her incredible Fitzroy home! "

Sharyn es muy buena onda y tiene  un perro q se llama Roger que es muy cari√±oso.
La casa esta bien ubicada, cerca de todo y con buenos accesos a medios de transporte y centro comerciales.
Lo √∫nico malo es que tiene una obra en construcci√≥n justo en la ventana de la habitaci√≥n y si te hospedas d√≠as de semanas es ruidoso desde temprano.
La higiene de la casa no era buena, especialmente los espacios comunes.

It could not be in a better location, so central! We walked around the city all weekend, there was no need for ubers. 
Dan was so quick to reply to all my messages and even messaged to check how we were going during the trip, a lovely host. 
And last but certainly not least, the space... pictures don‚Äôt do it justice! We spent so much time there relaxing, cooking and enjoying a glass of wine or two. 
Dan‚Äôs place was worth every cent and I‚Äôll definitely be back!"

We love Fitzroy and had an absolute ball roaming nearby Gertrude, Smith and Brunswick streets - window shopping, coffee sampling and big breakfast indulging.

A heartbeat from Fitroy central whilst still within walking distance to the city. I always felt at home and greatly appreciated Ramona's informative tips for how to navigate Melbourne - all the hard decisions when on holiday - what to see, where to eat, where is the best coffee.....Ramona has created a vintage atmosphere that blends into the Melbournes locale seemlessly creating an experience to remember with lots of room to find your own (Website hidden by Airbnb) endless supply of fantastic bread and muffins to choose from before stepping out."

This was our first AirBnB experience and the bar has been set very high now!

Loren and Ruth thank you so much for making us feel so welcome in your home and for sharing your beautiful space. You're fantastic people with such welcoming, warm and open personalities. If you're ever in Sydney, look us up before tolerating another catastrophe like the last time!!!

- Bridget is very accommodating and provided flexible check in and out

- Kitchen amenities provided

Cons
- Cleanliness level and the space itself was more like staying at a friend's place than a hotel. Which isn't a con if that's what you're looking for!

The ease of accessing the apartment on check-in, the thorough instructions book (""how to"" maps, laundry, appliances etc) and emergency contact numbers - every detail was taken care of, there were even complimentary re-loadable transit cards available that we ended up using a lot to check out beaches outside the city. I'll be coming back every year for a work trip and this is definitely the place I want to stay every time!
Thanks Rebecca :)"

I left my sunglasses at this place by mistake when I left and they were immediately returned to me, which I really appreciated.

Free parking too, which is a plus in this area.  The place is nicely furnished and well kitted out for long stays. Love the interim clean during our stay also.  Cheers."
280698,279848937,2018-06-21,25077606,Natalie,99,"We had a great stay at Frank and Vince's apartment at the Old Hat Factory.  We liked it so much we've already booked our next stay with them. The apartment is stylish, great for long stays, and we loved the interim clean, which not many people offer, free parking a bonus too. The location is great, cafes and restaurants less than 1 minute walk, tram stop out front which can take you to the city or in the other direction Glenhuntly Rd, Elsternwick, more restaurants and a cinema.  It is also a lovely walk through one of my favourite places - the St Kilda Botanical gardens to Acland St, as well as other St Kilda eateries and attractions and easy walk to the beach as well.  Frank and Vince were very helpful and prompt communication with any queries.  Thanks for a lovely stay."

We arrived to the most beautiful welcome from lovely Sharyl and left making a new friend! 
She was the perfect host, gorgeous place and super central... she was a life  saver when we forgot our UK adapters and even fetch me some hair spray for the night out. 
Let's not forget the silver fox Roger. It was an absolute delight to stay there.  Perfect central location, if you are an adventurous traveller you will more than enjoy this place... and if you are not you will enjoy it too!! And get lots of pointers along the way.
Sharyl was accommodating, funny, helpful. She looked after us it was like staying with your favourite cousin or long time old friend.  I have no words to recommend this place enough."

Very clean & tidy with lovely touches like area guide books / walking maps / business cards from local restaurants & galleries to check out + a fresh jug of water + glass beside my bed on arrival etc. 
Fabulous location in funky area of town & the local tips provided made for a great couple of days exploring the area. The CBD + transport options are very close & yet you wouldn't even need to go there with loads to explore near-by all within walking distance.

283257,113453867,2016-11-12,150042,Natashja,95,"Staying with Lulu and Michael in Fitzroy was the best choice we made. Lulu was amazing, the house was amazing and Fitzroy is the coolest area ever!!! This is exactly why I love Airbnb and both host and travel here. The experience is so personal when you have a caring host and you are living like a local. From the very start of communicating with Lulu until after we left - you could sense that Lulu is really a host that goes above and beyond to ensure that her guests are well looked after and comfortable. She was waiting in front of the house when we arrived and spent as much time as we needed to settle in, showed us around and answered all the questions we had. The house in itself is just perfect for Fitzroy. It is very comfortable - we had everything we needed - a bit of heat as it was a cooler spring, but it also works as aircon and I am sure every bit as well as the heater. Comfortable beds and the beautiful shower in the trees upstairs. The light in the afternoon fell beautifully in through the shades of the patio and the stained colored glass cast the prettiest shadow onto the staircase wall. So Lulu was great, the house was perfect - we had everything we needed. And the location is also just perfect. It is right in the middle of Fitzroy, a few minutes from the supermarket and an abundance of caf√©s and restaurants that will have you confused as to which to choose as there are so many great ones! Listen to Lulu's advice. It is great! Go to Archies for breakfast and Naked for Satan for a drink and the view for sure! We can't thank you guys enough for your hospitality!  Hope to be back for more another time :) All the best from us!"

We started in front of Harajuku station, in the morning, when the normally crowded streets were quiet. From there, Yulia took us along many back streets and side street, seeing sights and places we would never had noticed on our own.

Before this, we were slightly nervous; ‚Äúhow should we act in a photo shoot?‚Äù, we asked each other. But with Yulia, we were able to feel comfortable, and really enjoy the experience.

We were very happy with our morning with Yulia, and how the photos turned out."

241263,52167580,2015-10-26,1881477,Neeraj,100,"I had a lovely time staying at Gloria's apartment over the weekend in Melbourne. Gloria is a very warm and caring person. She went the extra mile to make me feel comfortable and welcome. She took time in giving me a tour of the house and the apartment, and made sure that I was comfortably settled. She explained the tram routes and even gave me a spare myki card. I was lucky to get her suggestions on where to dine, what places to visit, and enjoyed some great conversation over tea and cakes that she had prepared. She was very flexible in working with my schedule, and left me to my own devices, if I needed to be. Her cat is a very handsome fellow, and we really hit it off from the get go. 

The house has beautiful 180 degree views of the neighborhood. It is a 15 min drive to the city center, and yet, is located amidst quiet and peaceful surroundings. There was an international fiesta going on in the parks close by while I was there, and I enjoyed the food stalls serving cuisines from different parts of the world. The apartment has all amenities that you would need.  Gloria had kept her fridge stocked, and I enjoyed some great coffee and tea. The apartment has a garage parking which was convenient as I had a rental car during my trip. While the apartment and the neighborhood in itself is beautiful, what I remember the most from my short trip was Gloria herself, and what a great welcoming host she was!

There is a grocery store which is just 50 metres away.The studio is quite sufficient for two people and has more than basic amenities. It includes kitchen utensils, dryer, iron, TV etc. Allan's partner was very kind in giving us the required information about the city and the different tour options. She was also kind enough to invite us for the Boxing day lunch  and also offered me to use her home grown vegetables in the backyard. Their backyard is filled with different species of plants, flowers and veggies.
The house was very clean and we are extremely happy with our stay."

Gloria ever present in person or by phone and is flexible with any arrangements with her guests ... like where would like your office space? Binoche has a great personality but Binoche rules - so no matter whether the weather is hot or cold, his glass window is always left open for his business ... but the location and panoramic views are absolutely fascinating and  always changing. The double size bath has to be just the best!   "

The house is situated about 50m from lively Brunswick Street and all the cafes and bars but is nice and quiet at the same time.
Kate made recommendations about restaurants to try and how to get there and whether they get busy or not, all valuable information if you have not been to this area before.
The No. 11 tram from Southern Cross Station drops you a very short distance from the house.
I enjoyed Nearby restaurant Smith and Daughters and The Standard pub, both only around 50m away.
I thoroughly enjoyed the stay but as always there is never enough time to do everything. "

Being first time visitors in Melbourne, we did not know many people here, and John was very helpful in providing us lots of info to help us settle into this city. We found John to be a warm and friendly person and a great host. We enjoyed our daily conversations with John, discussions about various things in life and even shared a meal with our hosts. We'd be happy to strongly recommend John to anyone who's looking for a good place to stay in Melbourne"

The place itself is amazing, decorated with very cool antiques and vintage nic nacs. The room we stayed in was decked out like a hotel with beautiful organic chocolates and  a bunch of goodies on our arrival. There were maps/things to do/brochures in the room so we could find out how best to explore the city. Ramona also supplied beautiful sourdough breads and juices for breakfast which were delicious.

I highly recommend staying here if you are with your partner or by yourself.

I know we will definitely be staying there on our next visit."

On my first day, he patiently waited for my arrival and even took me around the area to let me be more familiar with the important spots around. Also, his house is extremely neat with many good amenities at your disposal. His room was extremely comfortable and it looks exactly like how it's shown in his profile. During my stay, he was very accomodating and never inconvenienced me at all. It is I who had to borrow the occasional phone since I did not have an Australian number and he would always provide his service as a host generously."

An organic food store a 2 minutes walk away.   Try Alimentari for breakfast.  Yum.  kitchen was well equipped bathroom also.  Everything you could need. But because there are
So many good restaurants nearby we didn't use kitchen!   For eating try Fonda (mexican). Jimmy grants (Greek). Could go on. Forever. Highly recommended apartment.  "

That made a part of our relaxing experience i guess. I myself was astonished to find rice cookers and a wide range of seasonings including Asian ones. One more thing is the convenient location, just a few minute walk to IGA and Domain interchange. And Judy was a very warm-hearted host. Everything was just lovely. I am pretty sure I am to stay in Judy's place if there s another chance."

Welcoming, peaceful, relaxed, and respectful are all accurate descriptions of the home, as well as the host. The property was spotless l (Website hidden by Airbnb) I felt so relaxed at your home, whether I was there alone or with you and/or other guests around. You foster such a welcoming and peaceful environment that it seems to 'rub off' on any guest, therefore mesmerising us all into a relaxed and caring state of mind!"
72576,1638032,2012-07-05,1215166,Nicco And Wit,92,"Staying at Little George Street is a little like staying with friends who have a lovely, welcoming house without having to worry about how you can repay them for their generosity at letting you stay with them.  All the previous reviews have well described the room and the house itself, most have indicated Ramona's talent for making you feel at home. I have little to add except that Ramona should probably run master classes in how to run a bnb.  My partner and I have been thinking of joining the bnb world, making our spare bedroom available. Staying at Little George Street couldn't have been a better introduction to what makes a great bnb - from the well equipped bedroom with flowers on the bedside tables, ipod dock and bathrobes to the great help-yourself breakfast goodies for breakfast (and midnight snacks - I couldn't keep away from the organic rye bread and the walnut and honey loaf!). Breakfast of course had to be followed by the short trek up the road to De Clieu on Gertrude St, home to serious coffee making and already missed."

Ramona, as countless reviews have stated, is a great host with a great house. As I was at a conference I didn't spend much time in the room - but it was very comfortable. In winter, the floors are heated and the bed is great. Having your own toilet is a plus. And, goes almost without saying, but location, location!

We have never felt so welcome while travelling before- Sharyn was a wonderfully hospitable and friendly host who made us instantly feel at home. We had never used AirBnB before and didn't really know what to expect, but after such a great experience we are clear converts! 

We were in Melbourne doing research before opening a cafe later in the year, and Sharyn was so generous with her time and advice in directing us to places to eat and drink. The woman has impeccable taste! Outgoing, funny and warm, she really was the perfect host, and we look forward to staying in touch and will definitely be back when we are next in Melbourne. Her dog Roger is handsome and really sweet. We have dogs at home so having him around was a wonderful bonus for us, but he was so laid back and well-behaved everyone is sure to love him.

Everything about Sharyn's apartment suited us perfectly. I initially thought the bus driver must have made a mistake when he dropped us off opposite the State Library because the location was so central. And then I walked in to her lovely home and couldn't believe how much space there was! She has everything you could need for an enjoyable stay. Our room was clean and bright with plenty of space, and our bed was very comfortable and warm (even for us two Queenslanders in what felt like sub-Antarctic Melbourne). Sharyn was worried about noise from a nearby building site but we didn't really notice it.

We are so grateful to Sharyn for opening up her home to us and making us feel so welcome. It was what made this trip to Melbourne so much better than the others! Thanks so much again. Hope to see you and Roger again sometime soon.

John made me very welcome during my brief stay. He is a very hospitable, gracious and friendly host who quickly put me at ease upon my arrival. He gave me some very good suggestions for things to see in Melbourne while I was there, for which I am grateful to him. He respected my privacy when I was at home, but at the same time was always happy to have a chat.

Overall a very satisfying and pleasurable experience. I would certainly take advantage of John's hospitality in future visits to Melbourne."

She has retained and celebrated most of the block‚Äôs period features, making it a very classy place to stay.  The furnishings are stylish and comfortable, and of an excellent quality throughout.  Great kitchen and bathroom.  Location-wise could not be better, with a tram passing by with quick connection to the city train and to St Kilda."

Gloria was super sweet and a more perfect host can not be imagined; she gave us tips for the surroundings, made us feel very much at home, and was always in for lovely conversations ( however, we are sure that people who prefer more privacy will find her giving all the space one needs). The facilities are very clean and modern, and one gets a own bathroom. The apartment is located north of Melbourne city center, which enables one to reach the nightlife etc. In about 15 min by tram. The breakfast provided was lovely and wonderful, and she even helped us with our laundry. Summarized we can say that if every airbnb experience is like the one we had with Gloria, we would be extremely satisfied and happy travelers!"

Loren was prompt in her replies, and very clear with her instructions. There were no problems in transaction, to getting to the apartment. The apartment looks just as it is in the photos, very cozy and full of character. Location is superb. A short walk away from the trams that will bring you straight to the city, very easy to get to Fitzroy (which we love!), and Richmond itself has alot to offer.
Loren and Ruth are very good hosts - they are warm, hospitable and very, very funny! I am especially appreciative that they made my partner, Karen's bday a memorable one!
Overall, I will highly recommend this place for its great location, the comfortable apartment, as well as the efficiency and hospitality of the hosts."

She was helpful, accommodating, flexible and great at communicating. Her apartment was immaculate and clean. The interior is stunning, elegant & sexy! Her attention to detail in the decor of the apartment needs to be mentioned. There were white roses placed in the kitchen and bedroom when I first checked in, which was a nice touch.  The location of it in South Yarra is also perfect. It's next to the train station and tram stops along Toorak road and Chapel st. There is an amazing cafe Two Birds and One Stone downstairs that does good coffee and brunch. Also a fine patisserie Adriano Zumbo is next door which serves beautiful cakes and desserts. Everything about Mia's apartment was perfect for me... I was really comfortable during my long stay in Melbourne and would definitely recommend her place to anyone!"

Es gab keinerlei Einschr√§nkungen Ihrerseits was das h√§usliche Miteinander betrifft. Auch war sie √ºberaus hilfsbereit, wenn es um die Orientierung in Melbourne ging. Ihr Haus ist perfekt gelegen. Armadale ist meiner Meinung nach eine der sch√∂nsten Viertel in Melbourne. Hinzu kommt eine ideale Anbindung an das √∂ffentliche Verkehrsnetz mit Train, Tram und Bus.

No need for a car, especially now that all trams in the CBD are free, 24/7. He greeted us at the cute Chocolate cafe on Collins St and gave us the instructions for the building and some really great recommendations for restauarants and bars, nice guy all round. The apartment is a beaut, artworks, as can be seen in the photos, everywhere really add to the Melbourne city vibe. It is very modern, immaculate and spotless. I think you would pay at least 50 to 100% more for something similar in a Hotel. It has all the amenities of an apartment as opposed to a hotel room eg Full size fridge, kitchen, a bookshelf full of books. Fully recommend, 5 star."

He provided me with a lot of useful advice about how to get around Melbourne and even offered to pick me up at a bus stop. When I finally had the pleasure of meeting him, he was warm and friendly and immediately made me feel like I was right at home. He offered me tea or coffee right away which I unfortunately had to decline as I was exhausted upon my arrival at his home. I wish I could have stayed longer."

41836,519887,2011-09-11,529069,Pablo,96,"Diana is a very good hostess, very worried about all the details, even before you get to her home.

The room was quite nice and big enough, and the location of the house is OK, but if you can get a bike, your stay will really much better. 

The closer train station is arround 1 Km far away from the home, and the supermarket is just two stops from the train station that is closest to the house. 

The house is just 15Km far away from the city centre, and you has to consider that Melbourne is huge, because almost all the Aussies live in houses instead of big buildings, so If you are going to visit melbourne for just a couple of days, consider that you are going to spend some time traveling from one side to other every day.

Many thanks Diana, we really enjoy our staying in your home during the last month"

There are lots of cafes and restaurants within walking distance, including some semi-hidden, extremely hipster-y, and rather pleasant places within a two block radius. (Make sure you look carefully for them if that's what you're into -- they're easy to miss!) Frank and Vince were great hosts. I called them after my first night in the apartment asking for more blankets, and they brought them within a couple of hours. For the rest, everything went very smoothly: the apartment was clean, the check-in process was easy, etc. All in all, this is a good value and well taken care of place in Melbourne.

Unfortunately it was quite cold when we stayed but the apartment heating was easy to use and heated the whole apartment which made for an extremely comfortable stay.
The kitchen had lots of spices and quite a few staples, while the laundry had washing powder etc and both bathrooms had plenty of toiletries all of which were a nice touch.

Sorry Karen and Jim !
Ok!

We visited our son Darren,his wife Brooke and identical twins Townes and Aidan in Yarraville some months back and stayed in Karen and Jim's home.
 Their house is situated in a quiet, leafy and friendly suburb in Newport with lots of open green areas and parks and only 10 mins stroll to the train station which runs to Melbourne or to the great place Williamstowm and Williamstown Beach !!
Newport is only 20 mins from the center of Melbourne (also checkout Footscray for a bit of shopping!!)
My wife and I found Karen and Jim and little Bella and Austin to be friendly and warm.
 Our room was spotless and roomy and quiet.Also the bathrooms and showers were excellent and private.
It is a very ' lived in'  house with plenty of ' just relax and enjoy' feeling!
Because we were visiting our son Darren and family every hour counted during our stay
We were up and on the move very early each morning and returned late at night so we missed out on getting to know Karen and Jim's family a bit more (regret)
Karen and Jim are warm and friendly hosts blessed with lovely children and we recommend them and their home.
Karen and Jim many thanks and will be in touch for a return visit !

Pat and Frances.

Clare is kind that allowed us to check in earlier knowing that we were arriving that morning so we could have her place to settle down and allowed us to  eat some snacks that provided in her refrigerator, which was really appreciated.

The house was big and clean. Bedrooms are really good, each room has an attached bathroom. Everyone enjoyed staying there, we almost feel is in our own house which was so comfy.
It‚Äôs a was amazing and the advises received in regards to our travel itinerary were fantastic and made our trip easier and more relaxing.  

The Location is great! The house is close to Puffing Billy Train. A few shops and restaurants just down the road, superb for buying some ingredients for cooking ! We did travel up to Yarra Valley for day trip.

We tried our best to keep the place clean and leaving it back to its original style as it should be. Truly enjoyed this house and will recommend anyone who would like to stay in Belgrave  to enjoy the slow pace and serene way of life!

Its a great holiday house for big group or family that are driving around.

Hoang and Michael were accommodating and replied frequently to any questions we had. Would definitely recommend staying here if anyone is in Melbourne for an extended period of time and if you want to do some walking around a different area."

The house way clean and tidy, exactly as pictured, warm and welcoming. It's a perfect place to explore Melbourne from with great access to public transport (plus Loren has a somewhat amazing knowledge of the public transport system!) whatever way you're heading. There are plenty of great bars, cafes and restaurants right on your doorstep to. Last but not least, the bed is very comfortable. Thanks for a great stay :)"
365832,63024563,2016-02-19,9670880,Patrick,100,"I stayed at Susan's apartment for a week while taking a course in Melbourne.

Susan met me at the apartment and was very welcoming, showing me through her place, giving me tips on local cafes and transport and making me feel very welcome.

Her apartment is exactly as described, very light and comfortable. Susan provided me with everything I needed (towels, use of washing machine etc). Her apartment is close to public transport (train and tram). It is quite close to the train line though, if you are a very light sleeper this may be an issue, however I got used to it after a couple of days. Her apartment is also an easy 2min walk to Carlisle St with plenty of cafes and restaurants, and about a 10-15min walk to the centre of St Kilda.

I didn't see Susan after checking in, but I did see her flatmate Kass most evenings and she was also very welcoming, helpful and fun to chat with. "

She's got a great place located in a very cool part of town close to CBD and everything else you might need, shops, coffee houses etc. She's also very much into tennis which is a massive plus for somebody who travels all the way from London for Australian OPEN. I had an absolutely beautiful experience and will be coming back many times. "

Tucked away in a laneway just off the main shopping malls in the CBD. Everything was pretty much in walking distance, otherwise there's a tram just down the road. Sharyn & her dog Roger gave us a very warm & friendly welcome, took time to sit down & have a chat with us. Unfortunately, we had busy schedules and did not spend that much time in the house, but we might make up for that when we visit Melbourne next and hopefully get to come back to Sharyn's place :)

We happily recommend this host & apartment."

Views to the bay were great while drinking morning tea.
Room was very comfortable, neat and clean, as was the bathroom.
Host was very warm and welcoming and helped with suggestions regarding how to get around, what to see and where to eat.

My personal area consisting of bedroom, balcony, bathroom and small study was impeccable, provided with all I could possibly want and there was a vast range of up to date useful leaflets and other information on Melbourne. The shared areas consisting of a large lounge, kitchen dining room and terrace I mostly had to my self and were superbly stocked with a vast range of breakfast coffee etc materials. Ramona herself is the perfect hostess ready to help I am sure with anything. Added to all this is the splendid location only a short walking distance from Central Melbourne and very near excellent tram routes. Fitzroy is a historic suburb of Melbourne full of interesting shops, bars and restaurants. I thoroughly recommend. "

It is a very comfortable home, comfy bed, great shower, well appointed and stocked kitchen.
This apartment is perfectly situated in a very cool and vibrant part of town, with a train station a hop away. The myki cards included make getting around so easy. 
Great cafes and shops on the doorstep. Perfect for 1 or 2 people.

Ramona is a seasoned hostess, with true love and passion for the city of MEL!  Beginning with all the detailed information that she sent prior to our arrival, Ramona was a wealth of good tips and intel on the best things to see and do in Melbourne.  The apartment location was great - so close to everything: shopping, terrific restaurants and bars, as well as centrally located for public transportation.  Ramona's place is a true gem in the heart of the city.

43429,430124657,2019-03-29,47094712,Paul,99,"Rented for 13 nights for relatives, the unit is good, BUT
A landlord is required to give a tenant 'quiet enjoyment' not hammer outside the window on a Sunday morning. Once is forgivable, not all of a subsequent day, whilst being fully aware that the elderly tenant was resting inside. Add to that unauthorized access by a small boy, and privacy is an issue."

Very light and contemporary.  The real plus is Frank and Vince, who cannot do enough to help.

We would stay here again and reccommend staying here if you are in Melbourne."

70004,38730744,2015-07-18,32485814,Paul,92,"What a fantastic place to stay in my first couple of weeks in Australia. I couldn't of asked for more! Vicki is on the ball and knows exactly how to make some one feel welcome. Vicki kindly greeted me from The station and gave me a tour of Frankston. Vicki and her parents couldn't of been more sociable or helpful. The accommodation itself is not called 'The Palace' for no reason. It is spacious, in immaculate order with top facilities (wifi, laundry etc). It never felt cluttered with the other guests around. The photographs on airbnb don't capture how grand Vicki's house is. The house is situated not far from bus / train station with an easy commute to the city or the peninsular. I travelled daily to the CBD in just over an hour.
I would recommend 'The Palace' without hesitation to anyone. It was a joy to stay there and total value for money.
I hope I meet Vicki again and I know where I will be booking if the need arises!

78143,10625118,2014-02-28,12252277,Paul,92,"When we first arrived in Melbourne late at night after a taxing 24 hour trip from Dublin. Julie made us feel welcome straight away, even meeting us at the local rail station. She was extremely helpful, giving us advice and sharing her extensive local knowledge. Her two small dogs were delightful and made no sound throughout our stay.
Her beautiful home was all that we could have hoped for - comfortable and tastefully maintained, situated in a modern, privately owned, securely gated residential development. We had our own key to come and go as we pleased. We were able to make full use of the kitchen (including a washing machine), private bathroom, garden, communal pool and she encouraged us to treat it as our own.
Within a few minutes walking distance of a local hotel, bottle shop and pub, 5 minutes from the rail station and 10 minutes from the main street of Prahran, it was an ideal base from which to explore all that greater Melbourne metropolis and beaches has to offer. It was just perfect."

Firstly Fiona's communication was fantastic with every thing you can imagine explained and detailed exactly as you would want, all the thinking done for you just follow Fiona's tips etc and you are sorted. The apartment was beautifully decorated with touches of France and other wonderful places in Europe tastefully placed here and there. I felt it was home from home and that is a nice feeling when you are exploring Mel. Location was perfect and only came very obvious to us when we walked into CBD on our first night and were pleasantly surprised to find where we were. All in all it is a fantastic apartment in a fantastic location in a fantastic city, what more can I say except ""fantastic"".
Many thanks Fiona"

From our initial contact through Airbnb through to meeting us at her workplace on the morning we arrived to collect keys, she was kind and thoughtful and genuinely happy to help us with advice. She had transport cards ready to hand us to use. And a great big smile. Each evening we arrived home she would turn off the tv and curl up for a good chat with us, even if she was enjoying her show. Judy loves her home. It's easy to see how happy and comfortable she is there. She had bottles of water and fresh towels on our bedside tables for us. She was very clear on rules of the house. Nothing strict. Just general good manners and respect. The bed was really comfortable and we had our own bathroom. She even chased after us in her car an hour after we left to give us our clothes that we forgot to bring with us. She really is the essence of good hosting and customer service."

I only stayed there 5 nights but would definitely re-visit if in the area.   I very much appreciated the gift he gave me when I left and also the lesson in the correct way to cut a mango!"

Alan was a wonderful host, making me lunch on arrival and directing me to various vegetarian options in the city for dinner. (Note: try Swanston St for several 'all you can eat for $7.50' options) Jack and Amy also seemed pretty happy to see me again...though Amy - as befitting a cat - was a little less expressive than Jack! btw the bed is one of the comfiest I have slept in....I keep forgetting to ask what make it is! 
Will definitely stay with Alan again next time I visit Melbourne :)"

The location was excellent as it's incredibly close to trains, trams and within walking distance to the beach. The beautiful Victorian house was spotlessly clean throughout and the hosts Colin and Chung were really welcoming.  What more could you ask for?

To start, she was a wonderful host who greeted us personally to show us everything in the apartment which was super helpful. Communication was spot on, and she even left us these fun restaurant/bar cards that directed us to all the best places in Melbourne. You couldn't ask for a better host!
The space itself is super unique (make sure to use the swing and huge bathtub!) and very private with stunning views of the city. Location is central and so close to public transportation. Can't wait to go back one day!!"

The self contained unit was better than expected and has everything you would ever need. The unit was very private with separate access to the main residence, so if you're after privacy this is the place to go. I was very happy with my stay and would recommend them to anyone. "

This is probably the fifth time I have stayed with them which says a lot!  I enjoy working through Airbnb which I found to be very efficient.  The reason why I enjoy staying with them is because I have a son and grandchildren who live nearby and it is just so convenient and so comfortable - home from home!

The room itself is light, airy and spacious, with a comfortable bed, own balcony, wardrobe space and ensuite with large shower (and lovely organic soaps/shampoo etc).  Being on the top floor we had total privacy - in fact we hardly saw anyone else the whole time we were there!  Thoughtful touches include the jug of water by the bed and a welcome bar of organic chocolate!

You have the use of Ramona's well-equipped kitchen and very comfortable living space.  She also provides a good selection of  teas/honey/jams etc, and very yummy breads from the organic bakery!

The location in Fitzroy couldn't be better - an easy walk to Brunswick Street, Gertrude Street, Smith Street, and even into the city.  Ramona is a great host - she was away for most of the time we were there but readily contactable by phone.  She also provides very clear and welcome instructions on how everything works!  

I highly recommend staying at Ramona's home - we'll certainly be back next time we're in Melbourne.

263871,56408163,2015-12-13,10860080,Penny,98,We had a wonderful time while staying in Eliisa's apartment.  It was spacious and clean with all the amenities we required. It is a fantastic location - right in the middle of the everything.  The cafe downstairs with good coffee was a bonus.  It was also nice that previous guests had left behind a few toiletries and bits of food.  There was even a needle and thread that I needed for some emergency repairs! The range of different teas was amazing!  We would certainly stay there again. 
244952,3500961,2013-02-09,4202581,Penny,100,"We loved the apartment.  It is very light and airy, furnished in vintage style  - shabby/chic.

Really hope we can come back again."

315513,26264970,2015-02-08,25478673,Perry,98,"Ryan's place was absolutely stunning when we first arrived. It was by far the best decorated apartment we have ever come across. Everything was accurately described, the rooms were nice and tidy. Ryan was very friendly and he even had his own information package and suggested routes to go for a day trip or two. The jacuzzi and the BBQ was a plus. Ryan's big dog Romeo was also very well-tampered and you could either play with him or if you are afraid of dogs, Ryan would be more than welcome to ask Romeo to keep a distance from us. Overall a definitely nice experience in Ryan's place, and we will probably be staying at Ryan's place when we come to Melbourne again. "

Noisy at night but we were so exhausted from the days adventuring we slept through without a drama. You definitely do not need a car!

The third floor bedroom with en suite bathroom, small terrace and office is beautiful, charming and full of character - and as comfortable as many much more expensive ""boutique"" hotels I have stayed in.  Tastefully decorated, pristine with pretty rooftop view.  And Ramona is a wonderful host - very readily available to help and super knowledgable but in no way intrusive.  For good reason she loves Fitzroy - it is a delightful area to stay, lots going on but with a local ""neighborhoody"" feel.  Plenty of great restaurants within walking distance and trams nearby to go further afield.   A decent run to see a bit of the city: (Website hidden by Airbnb) but there are plenty of others too at (Website hidden by Airbnb)

It was good to have somewhere to retreat to.  We absolutely loved the quirkiness and liveliness of the Fitzroy area with its shops and cafes.  This was a bonus on our trip and far better than staying in the CBD.  The arrangements for our arrival all worked well and you were very accommodating about our uncertain timings.  Your thoughtfulness in the welcome were appreciated: the fruit, wine and other foods left for us, together with your attention to detail in terms of our preferences for Yorkshire tea! The apartment was as spacious and light as described.  It's possible some guests might be taken aback by the route in down the back alley, wondering if they've come to the right place, but they shouldn't be put off; behind the door, there's a haven of quiet and light.  Thanks for everything you did to make us welcome. Peter & Rae"
76867,190299704,2017-09-04,50244217,Peter,95,The apartment was clean and tidy. And the welcome was great and the location is central and easy to get to.
310594,23544079,2014-12-04,3601458,Peter,90,"The location was perfect for us. Upstairs the home is full of light due to its good design. On the few hotter days inside is pretty warm so glad it wasn't later in summer as the bed space is elevated closer to the roof where the heat is more intense. 

"
257915,309857367,2018-08-19,169359908,Peter,97,The units are fine and the location is good. Some difficulty in getting in touch with the host to check in after being given incorrect information. After that everything was good - the units are well maintained and were very clean. 
161033,52566204,2015-10-31,26308921,Peter,100,"This BnB has been the best we have stayed in, our hosts we welcoming and very hospitable. The location is a dream, quiet, relaxing and very private. I would recommend our little cabin without hesitation. "
244952,150713717,2017-05-08,9114680,Peter,87,"This is a perfectly located little unit for experiencing Fitzroy's Brunswick Street and catching the trams for a short trip to the city is only a 100 metres or so away.
The location is very quiet and green. WiFi, heating and TV worked well during our visit and the bed was very comfortable.  The basics of items needed to garnish your cooking  were left in the kitchen.
A good selection of books on numerous topics made available for guests to read."
363278,5630880,2013-07-08,7308945,Peter,87,"This was my first AirBnB experience and it couldn't have been better.
Extremely comfortable, lovely environment, delightful host who put up with me basically using his place like a hotel which I booked at the very last minute.
Can't recommend highly enough."
70328,101736826,2016-09-15,91439136,Peter,98,"This was my first use of Airbnb for accommodation and I didn't really know how it would work out. I came down for a few days work in Melbourne
It certainly far exceeded my expectations. I felt a bit awkward walking into someone else's house, but  Raewyn made me feel at home and relaxed from the beginning, and free to use the kitchen and lounge areas. Had some good chats.
 The place itself was a real surprise, extremely well kept, a large private room - good for resting and a bit of homework, and large kitchen and lounge room and gas heater for some  rather wet Melbourne evenings. I felt  at home, and slept really well.
The location is great and went for a walk around the bay - plenty of good restaurants nearby.
It was a real pleasant surprise for me, and will be back a few more visits this year .
"
78143,7954279,2013-10-09,9161791,Peter,98,"Very comfortable accommodation. Lovely quiet location, great transport links, and welcoming, friendly and helpful host. Terrific in every respect."
72576,1252224,2012-05-09,1853577,Peter,100,"We felt very comfortable and ""at home"", staying at Ramona's spacious and  nicely furnished apartment. Being close to winter the nights were cold outside but we were very cosy and warm overnight. We would certainly come back and stay at Ramona's. The location is ideal, close to trams and close to a great variety of cafes, wine-bars, and  restaurants and not far away is Lygon street, an easy stroll. "
284210,286690028,2018-07-06,115267189,Peter,99,"We had a great time in Kate‚Äôs lovely apartment, which is so convenient to the city and great restaurants and shops, and yet secluded and quiet at the same time. Would definitely stay again!"
72576,7222907,2013-09-11,3784718,Peter,0,We had an excellent stay at Ramona's in the apartment with its own ensuite on the top floor. The apartment is in an excellent location close to trams and shops and restaurants. Ramona's was very quick in responding to my emails and text messages. In fact we have stayed at a few airbnb apartments and Ramona would have to be the best in her responses. To be able to use the kitchen which was so big and clean  and had everything was great. We mainly ate out but had breakfast and a couple of lunches at the apartment. Our bedroom was on the top floor but was no trouble in getting our bags to and had its own shower and toilet. There were other guests staying in the downstairs rooms but we very rarely saw or heard them. Would definitely stay there again next time we are in Melbourne. 
256186,20812135,2014-10-06,15260144,Peter,98,"We have stayed at Hoang's fabulous Collingwood apartment three times this year, ranging from 1 week to 3 weeks at a time, and it now feels like our little home in Melbourne.  This funky apartment is roomy, very clean and well equipped - there's nothing they haven't thought of.  Hoang and her husband Michael and two gorgeous children live above the apartment and were very considerate of any noise we may hear from their daily lives.  They made us very welcome and happily took care of anything we needed.  The location around the corner from vibrant Smith Street and a short walk to Brunswick Street meant we were on the doorstep of very regular trams into the CBD, restaurants, cafes, bars and interesting shops. We even walked into the city through the beautiful Fitzroy Gardens when we wanted. A stay in this area is certainly more interesting than staying in the CBD and one gets a real sense of what it is like to live in Melbourne.  Can't recommend this apartment highly enough. "
150729,2185214,2012-09-03,1701822,Peter,96,"We were in Ramona's place in early September 2012. The location is great for those wanting to be close to bohemian Fitzroy, or to take a short tram ride into the Melbourne CBD, however the house is located in a quiet lane. Ramona is an easy going host and all of her directions to find and access her house worked very smoothly. Being able to park in the street near the house, courtesy of Ramona's car parking permit, was a great advantage for us on a driving holday. The house was very quiet, tidy and meticulously clean and had everything that we needed. Ramona provided organic teas, delicious muffins and bread from her local bakery and we definately recommend a visit there! All in all we had an excellent stay and would recommend Ramona's place to other travellers - we would certainly stay there again. 

Peter and Ella"
76867,11582258,2014-04-08,4521866,Peter,0,"We were very lucky chosing Judy as our host in Melb.  Everything is just perfect: location, room, bathroom. Situated on the 11th floor you have a great view over the city and you can even watch the ships coming in or leaving.
Judy is such a lovely host, very good to talk to and was always keen to offer the best recommondation we asked for.
In short: there's nothing to complain about. We loved our three nights in her apartment and especially appreciate the evenings talking to her. Thank you Judy for everything, we enjoyed it very, very much and really want to come back one day."

Allan & Lizzy did all they could to make sure we had a pleasant stay. The unit is very well appointed including a full kitchen. We were greeted with a lovely welcome pack of breakfast food, fruit and chocolates. The view from the kitchen window to a little corner of Java is quite unique. We would definitely return and highly recommend this place to anyone wanting a delightful home away from home."
150729,893115,2012-01-31,1202474,Peter And Dung,95,"Our stay on Little George Street was fantastic.  The location in the Fitzroy neighborhood is perfect.  A two block walk will put you on either Brunswick Street, Gertrude Street or Smith Street which have the best shops and cafes in Melbourne.  You don't even need to leave the neighborhood to enjoy the best of the city.  The house has lots of style and a great place to hang out, though with all the things to do in town we hardly had the chance.  Highly recommended."
15246,25342737,2015-01-12,12687513,Petra,89,"Eleni is a very friendly and kind,  flexible and warm person. I felt at home immediately. She has a lovely house in a quiet environment. I slept in a spacious room. I can recommend this address in Melbourne North to everybody."

However, staying with Ramona at 95 Little George was an absolute delight! Ramona is a very special person who has an impeccable eye for detail and is able to tell you about all the nooks and crannies in her wonderful neighbourhood. Not to mention the lovely space and organic bread for breakfast...Simply perfect!"

283257,30678161,2015-04-26,8270907,Phil,84,"We had a very pleasant week's stay in this charming and quirky studio. It presented very well as described and pictured on Airbnb. Lulu and Michael were lovely hosts who accommodated our arrival and departure times and were very approachable and available if needed, although we didn't want for much as pantry staples and fresh essentials such as fruit, milk, eggs, etc. were kindly left for us on arrival. Fitzroy is a wonderful location to experience Melbourne's rich heritage while catering to all ages and walks of life. Diverse restaurants, pubs and bars are everywhere and also some great vintage shops. Public transport options abound to be able to explore other interesting nearby locales such as Northcote, Brunswick, North Carlton and Collingwood. We now have a new favourite Melbourne precinct!  In Lulu's words: ""Fitzrox!"""
78143,147299347,2017-04-26,122277293,Philip,92,"Great location by Prahran train station. Julie is lovely (even letting us pick up our bags late on our check out day, and understood our lateness in arriving on our first day) and the best bedroom/bathroom I have come across for anything like this price! Ideal as a place to rest your head as part of a  short stay in the city. Not really suited towards doing your own cooking.  Julie likes to keep the rooms well, opening windows, closing blinds and that. Thanks Julie"
47100,139388,2010-11-15,275697,Philip,97,"Hosts are friendly, helpful and cheerful. Flat situated in a trendy and upmarket part of town, close to trams & approximately 5km away from city centre. Good value. Beats renting an apartment any day; it's like staying with friends."

247140,116354400,2016-11-29,40267293,Philip,100,"Perfect place to stay for easy walkable access to MCG etc, but also for its closeness to the city. The walk along Wellington Parade and then Flinders Street is always interesting, and one is in the midst of things so quickly. Trams are accessible too. The place itself is lovely. "
72576,27675234,2015-03-09,2159611,Philip,99,"Ramona's place is really exquisite - she has great taste in decoration and we found her various collections really interesting. The room was big, comfortable and had its own balcony and bathroom (with a huge shower!). We loved staying there.

(The free bread from the bakery she works at was a real bonus. We really enjoyed our breakfasts in the kitchen and took ages to leave each morning!)"
72576,303632212,2018-08-07,439409,Philip,0,"Ramona's place is very special, great location, clean, unique and well equiped. Her local area tips were the best.
I highly recommend this listing. "
363278,62738236,2016-02-16,21551417,Philip,96,"This is a real find! Alan is a wonderful host, who made me feel completely welcome, provides lovely breakfast and can whip up a delicious dinner too, and gives good and personalised suggestions of things to do around town. 

The cottage is charming -- not such a tiny bedroom, a modern and well appointed bathroom, and a rose-filled garden in front. It is about 30 seconds to the tram stop, so you can be in the very centre of town in 20 minutes. The local neighbourhood Fitzroy is also very cool, so there are eating and drinking and funky shopping choices all around. 

I can't recommend this option enough. "
256186,37964829,2015-07-12,31954506,Philip,96,Very cool small apartment. Friendly and helpful hosts. Excellent location near Smith street. Fantastic places to eat nearby and a short tram ride to the city.

75109,126427880,2017-01-11,18227763,Philippe,99,Staying at Jim and Karen's place is like visiting family.

It is a very comfortable place in a very nice neighbourhood with lots of possibilities to run and go for a swim.

313648,31545283,2015-05-06,7992756,Phillip,99,Great location in East Melbourne which is a very sort after area of the city Perfect access to the principal sports area of Melbourne ie MCG / RodLaver Arena and AAMI Park plus walking distance through Fitzroy Park to CBD With the carparking included you can throw away the keys and just get on and enjoy metropolitan Melbourne The desk area and internet is perfect for business use but its also ideal for exploring the city Check in is great because Haydn offers 'meet and greet' or keysafe access to the apartment
75109,215626071,2017-11-30,127901649,Phillip,93,"If all AirBNB was like Karen and Jim's place, the hotel industry would be in serious trouble. They were so friendly, it was literally like being home away from home. Thanks guys for the great stay."

We even got bath robes! The location is excellent, close walk to the cafe's/bars/museum. Ramona gave me gluten free snacks which was very thoughtful of her. I've already recommended staying here to all my friends and I will certainly be returning next time I'm in Melbourne. A ++ Ten out of ten "
76867,549343,2011-09-20,544283,Phoebe,95,We had a delightful time with Judy in Melbourne!  She was fun to visit with and was very helpful.  The room was very clean and quiet and the view was to die for ..... Helps to be on the 11th floor!  I believe our Air B&B stay contributed to  our ultimate excellent impression of the city.  We are hoping that Judy will come see us next year in the USA.....

Came in handy on a rainy day. The location suited us as we walked everywhere within 15 minutes yet could also catch the free tram to the Dockland markets, the stop literally 40 seconds away. Overall it felt like we were stayng at a friend's house, it was warm and homely & we had a great time."
256186,312633329,2018-08-24,8241870,Piera,0,"The apartment is spacious, confortable.  We were 4 so 2 bathrooms would have been great but on Holiday who cares‚Ä¶ Good position, close to shops and tram to go into the city that is only 2 km away.  I would recommend staying here."

Not only is the location excellent, but the room was spotless and came with quick tips, brochures and a list of things to do. Ramona even included a power adapter! It felt like a true hotel, maybe even cleaner. The flat was super stylish and Ramona gave excellent advice on local spots and things to do. 10/10 would stay again."

The location is superb; it's exactly where I'd want to live if I were moving to Melbourne. It's close to a train station that gets one to the CBD or out of the city. There are great restaurants and the best caf√© in Melbourne -- all a walk away. The space itself, however, is sufficiently removed from all of it so as to be quiet in the later hours of the evening. The room is a good size and comfortable. I would stay again without question."

My plan was to travel around Australia and New Zealand for 2,5 months - to keep my financials under control I wanted to try hostels, knowing full well they might not be my thing. Surely, after the first night I cancelled all my hostel reservations and found Tania's place, which is in quick and easy reach of the town centre and within comfortable walking distance to 3 tram & bus lines. As a single female traveller I felt safe walking in the area even in the late evenings. Upon arrival, I crashed into bed jet legged and had the best sleep! In the morning I snuggled up and enjoyed the birds singing outside.

Chris is very helpful and interesting host. He helped us, to reach his place in late time when we've arrived to Melbourne, made many suggestions what we should visit in the city, showed us some hidden Melbourne gems, gave perfect advices where/what to eat and so on...

Just check how many reviews this guy has and there is no need to tell anything else :-)"

The place is nice and clean, stylish and practical, in great location that is close to everything we need but quiet enough that we can relax anytime we wanted to. We walked everywhere from here - to CBD, South Bank, cafe, restaurants, malls, etc... Ramona is excellent. She prepared the room with many thoughtful details that make us feel comfortable. Ramona also gives good tips and ideas for what to do and where to eat - all really good! We will definitely stay with Ramona again and also recommend her place to anyone."

It's in a great spot in Fitzroy, we walked everywhere and were very close to tons of cool restaurants, bars and shops. We also actually wanted to the CBD and Chinatown from her apartment and it was a very pleasant 20-30 min walk. Her apartment was very comfortable to stay in, the kitchen and living space was great. The bed was very, very comfy and we had a third person who slept on the couch, which was also perfectly comfortable to sleep on.  We had a rental car for a few nights and although there is a private parking space for her apt, we had some trouble with other people using the space sometimes.  Rebecca was very responsive to our issues with this, but just something to keep in mind if you'll have a car with you.  We had to find street parking on a couple occasions, which wasn't too hard to do. Overall, this was a great spot to be in while visiting the city and we had a wonderful time! "

Everything is already supplied, from cooking to laundry. The provided car space really does help out, as the street gets very busy depending on the times you are leaving and returning but being so close to the city and public transport, a personal car is not a necessity. Although Rebecca was overseas at the time of my stay, she was still very helpful and prompt with responses to queries.

307615,340149607,2018-10-23,165972250,Queencha,0,"WARNING!!
Please do not book this place! I got scammed $1900 AUD and airbnb only offered me $400 back!!

I stayed ZERO night here (I paid for a WHOLE MONTH) and had to look for an emergency accommodation as soon as I checked in! (The co-host left right after showing the house and didn't even offer to help me with my luggage to the stairs. Please note that I'm a small woman who prepared to stay there for a month).
I had every intention of staying in that house, but the condition was so bad that I was left with no other option than to search for an emergency accommodation. Why would I risk losing $1900 if the place is as good as the host claimed? Please do not get conned :(

Upon check in I found BLOOD/FECES STAIN in the supposedly ""freshly laundered"" towel. The host had ignore this issue.

The carpets are filled with hairball, dust, hays. The host keeps on blaming the age of her house. But please note that these dust on the carpets can easily be vacuumed! The carpets are blackened on the edge and full of dust everywhere.

The wifi is also not working (wrongly given, even!) when I checked in. Imagine having no internet, and found out hours later that the host sent you a message saying she just changed the wifi later from airbnb platform. How am I suppose to read a message on the internet if I don't even have an internet connection at that moment?.......... uhm.

Location: Gosh, In an alley with a rubbish facilitation right in front of it. NOISY. Which means rubbish trolley going in and out all the time, and no lighting at night in that alley. Extremely noisy as they process mainly glass recycling, so please imagine the noises and smell.

The house is a HOARDING place. I really wish I can attach some pictures here. It's super bad I'm out of words. The laundry room is filled to the brim of the ceiling with dirty clothes and other stuffs to the ceiling, I'm not even kidding I couldn't even see the washing machine.

The rooms in the house looks like a ship EXPLODED there. This expression can't even do the place justice on how messy it is. Dirty clothes left everywhere in layers leaving no space to walk. These rooms were left open upon my arrival and I felt so bad until I have to close them since they have 2 dogs and I don't want the dog to urinate there.

The whole place is a HYGIENE SAFETY HAZARD! With two dogs (which I don't mind) and the amount of stuffs left messily in the house and inside the room, a disease could easily spread there.

The ""back garden"" is filled with falling leaves and left unclean, when I brought up this issue they insist this is not rubbish.

Hot water not available 24/7.

The host use profanity when I requested a refund! And of course, she REFUSED. I stayed zero night there, and the host is well aware of the condition of the house and her extremely sub-par hygiene standard.

I have stayed in airbnb in over 10 countries in the last one year, left glamming review for every each one of them. But this one I had to write this so no-one else will get scammed like I did.

Why would I risk $1900 AUD if the place isn't that bad? Please think for yourself. Shame on the host who denied the whole claim and insist that I made it up on airbnb. 

Please save yourself some time and look for a proper nice hotel/ other airbnb.
I was scammed into this listing by the amount of glamming review I saw and how inaccurate it is. I would strongly suggest airbnb to investigate this 'SUPERHOST'. 

Airbnb standard is THAT LOW apparently, that you conned $1900 AUD out of an honest guest who simply report on an inaccurate listing which shouldn't even be there at the first place."

Oh and thanks for the generously stocked kitchen, breads, muesli, yummy muffins, selection of teas and more! Not to mention the bedroom we had is so cozy and comfortably warm for a winter stay! :) though throughout the stay we were busy in and out, thus didn't get to meet Ramona often but we managed to get some light chat, we find Ramona very friendly and she's really a welcoming hostess that asked us to make use of the house! :) It's definitely the perfect stay in Melbourne!

Dina was polite and accommodating, particularly when I changed my accommodation arrangements. I found the room kind of small, particularly as there was another bed up against the wall for my first two weeks there which left little maneuvering room. The room and bathroom in the picture were not the ones I was in. The bathroom is internal and where the washer dryer are. Storage was great in the bedroom but a bit tight in the kitchen. I was there during the cold of winter and found the apartment very cold. Although sheets were clean, some were stained and some dust balls etc under the bed (ear plugs that predated me too). The place was quite cluttered during the second half of my stay as Dina was doing a big clearout and sometimes smelled a bit smokey. The gym was small and very basic and often in the mornings all machines were in use. Mirrors in the bedroom and a hairdryer available for guest use where positives for me."

It's somehow cozy and spacious at the same time! Camilla met me as soon as I arrived to show me around the place. She was readily available to answer any questions I had about getting around and seeing the city, but was never intrusive. She was generous in the contents of the apartment as well - the use of her computer, internet, and her DVD collection. The price for the apartment is also very reasonable, given that it's in the city and costs less than most hotels in the area. It was a convenient and easy place to stay and I appreciate her generosity and hospitality! Would definitely recommend her to anyone visiting Melbourne, short or long term.

Super convenient and quiet location, in the heart of Richmond, within a 5 minute walk to either the bars and restaurants on Swan Street, or the shops on Bridge Road.  
Fully equipped, I had everything I needed for a relaxed and worry free stay.

Frank & Vince were fantastic hosts - I had a issue with my wifi, and they came and fixed it within a couple of hours.  

I'd recommend this apartment to anyone who wants a great location in the heart of Richmond, with easy access to the CBD via train or tram, easy access to the eastern freeway to get out to the suburbs and most importantly within walking distance to the shops, restaurants and cafes of Richmond.

Tips for the local area:
- supermarket on Church St (10 mins walk)
- great coffee and Brunch at Cheerio at the bottom of Lennox Street (5 mins walk)
- Fitzroy gardens are only 10 mins walk away (scenic for a walk, and good for running)
- Catch a gig at the Corner Hotel at the bottom of Lennox st (5 mins walk)
- Europcar car hire garage on Swan St (10 mins walk)
- 3 trams into the CBD within 5 mins walk (70, 75, 48)
- Cocktails at OST on Bridge Rd (5 mins walk)"

If food dishes being left out overnight & obvious dust piles on the floor & not fresh smelling sheets don't bother you then proceed.  Yes it's funky as described but a little more consideration for guests when it comes to simple floor sweeping,wiping dried toothpaste off the sink & cleaning dishes would have been nice.  
There were obvious stains on the sheets & pillow cases and as I was leaving 2 more guests were arriving while he wasn't home, so I'm pretty sure he didn't wash the sheets for them.  I stayed at friends hotel room 1 night to be in a clean bed.

When were booked the place we were looking for an apartment that was safe, clean, had the essential white goods and was within walking distance to the Australian Open.. and his apartment ticked all these boxes, the last one being the kicker - literally a 10min walk from the tennis arena or the MCG. Easy access to trains, trams and buses were a plus. "
43429,620743,2011-10-11,1223261,Raj,95,Place is preety good with all basic amenities (except iron and board and Internet). Internet was not provided so it was bit difficult for me as I am new in Australia. House Construction work is going just next door so was not able to sleep after 7 in morning. All in all it was ok for me.

The kitchen had everything we needed, which was good as we like to prepare our own food. It was in a great location - close to Bridge Road shops and cafes; MCG and close enough for us to walk to work in the city through the park which we really enoyed. Also has 3 train stations within 0.5 km and a tram stop right on the corner. When we weren't walking it was less than 0.5 hr to work. Marilyn was a very good host, clear with the details and in regular contact to ensure we had everything we need. The apartment lived up to the description and photos and we would recommend it to anyone, particularly those like us relocating to Melbourne who needed a good homely base. Thank you Marilyn!"

The flat is five minutes walk (max) from trains and trams into the city. It suited our needs perfectly. The laminated local map with supermarkets, eateries etc. upon it was great. Thanks.

43429,313968,2011-06-14,559362,Ralph,98,"This was a great place to stay as it was so close to the Clayton Campus of Monash. Very well located between 2 main roads so easy access by car everywhere including Chadstone shopping! The room was perfect - very new and so clean and warm and cosy. It had everything we needed, even a hair dryer.  The bed was comfy and there was even a bowl of fresh fruit. Allan was a great host and left us alone when we needed but was also a great help during the chaos caused by the volcanic ash.

We will certainly stay again. The garden was beautiful."

They made me welcomed, you have private bathroom and toilet and the bedrooms are at the other end of the house from theirs.  The place was clean and met expectations.  They were also very attentive and provided breakfast.  The guests also have a separate living room with a TV.  
The place is locate very close to the beach and local store.  There are about 8 Km away from a larger town where you could get lots of take away, however, if you wish, you could cook in the kitchen.  
Recommended to other guests!"

He fixed a great, healthy breakfast for us and noticed when we had not had it the first day (as we had a last minute appointment with my son for breakfast come up). He is educated, fun to talk with, considerate and pleasant. My daughter and I enjoyed having spent a few days at his place, and would definitely recommend him to anyone looking for an easily accessible, clean, safe place to stay.

Would love to have him visit us in South Dakota, where we live.

All the elements of the perfect arrangement were there:  great location, easily accessible by those great Melbourne trams; clean and comfortable accommodation; lovely neighborhood with every imaginable convenience within walking distance, and -- best of all -- a fine and friendly host.

Their home is incredibly beautiful and has every modern convenience you could ever need. Ryan and Rhiannon are very nice people and very helpful in offering suggestions on sights to see around Melbourne. I was especially grateful for being allowed to check in a little early as my jetlag was still gettiing the better of me and I really needed to catch up on my sleep after coming in on an overnight flight from Perth. Very easy access to the downtown area by freeway only took about 15 minutes by car , and the home is in  a nice, quiet,  suburban setting. "

He and her girlfriend were very friendly, although I didn't see them very much they were always willing to chat a little and provide everything that I needed during my stay. The room was very big, a bit cold but it had a little heater. The bed was huge and comfortable. Although the neighborhood is not that nice, the place was very well located with a tram stop literally at 10 meters. The city center was 20 minutes away. I would definitely stay at Linday's again, although I would try to avoid winter since the place had no heating haha Besides that everything was perfect!"
232088,165120088,2017-06-30,125665024,Rashmi,90,"The house was cosy & comfortable and more than what we expected. They put on a kettle for a hot cup of tea, just as we were checking in and they had also kept a starter pack consisting of cornflakes, fruits, noodles etc., which was very thoughtful. There was enough bed sheets, covers, blankets and towels for all four of us throughout our stay. Mal & Nok are very good hosts. They were just next door and always helpful. Melbourne CBD is just 12 Kms away and easily accessible via Buses and Trains. The place is centrally located with easy access to transport and shops. The park just across the property, is the perfect place for kids to play and run around. 
Thank you Mal and Nok for giving us a home away from home!! We loved it :-)

Other things that made my stay at Mia's apartment so wonderful was the fact that Two birds one Stone was downstairs (the french toast and tuna is divine) and Adriana Zumbo right next door, so for the fellow foodie, it was practically heaven! Top Paddock was also nearby and driving into the city only took 10 minutes! Mia was also really communicative and I didn't feel stressed in the lead up to the stay. I will definitely be coming back some time in September :)"

Everything was very clean, which is always important (well, for me!). 

Got a chance to speak to Linda and enjoyed my time with her. 

Getting into the centre of town was easy. Hop on the 109 tram a few minutes walk away and within 15 minutes you can get trams to anywhere else. 

When next in Melbourne, I wouldn't hesitate to stay with Linda again. If the room is free!

You will have everything you need at the house. There are two transport cards there for guests to use - you just need to add the value you need on the card - super convenient and making our lives easier. Unless you drive, you need the transport card everywhere you go.

72576,12737918,2014-05-10,5527879,Rebecca,0,"I could not have enjoyed my stay here more! The house is in an amazing location within steps of the tram. Ramona is amazing with communication, making sure that I had very precise instructions to take me right to the front door without incident. The suburb is quiet and safe, you'll have no worries walking home at night. The room itself, as well as the rest of the house, is beautifully furnished and not too cluttered. I am a stickler for cleanliness and Ramona did not disappoint. The house was spotless. She also pays attention to the finer details with making sure I had maps of the local area, myki card for the tram, a copy of the house guide and a spare set of keys for the friend joining me halfway through. She also set clean towels in my bed with a little block of organic chocolate on top welcoming me to the room which was a lovely touch. The few times I did see Ramona she was friendly, willing to have a quick chat or give me some travel tips. She was also super accommodating when it came time for me to leave. Even though she had other guests arriving to my room, she allowed me to keep the spare set of keys and leave my bags downstairs until I headed to the airport which I was incredibly grateful for and yet another little touch that makes this place so great. If you want to stay in a bright, clean, private room close to shops, cafes, public transport, the CBD and with a lovely host then you've found your place. "

The location of the flat is great too with only a 25 min walk to the city centre or you can easily get the trams but Fitzroy is such a cool area where you can find lots of quirky shops, bars and plenty of place to get a great breakfast too! I would love to come back and stay here!

The flat itself was lovely and Dan was very kind to send us some tips on local eateries  and shops. For those who are light sleepers the place can be a little noisy at night particularly the weekend which is when we stayed. But its a small price to pay considering the location.

Upon arrival we found we had some essentials provided for us; bread, milk, eggs, fruit.  Very thoughtful.  The bungalow is spacious, very clean and quite private.  The garden is a treat and Barbara is truly lovely.  We were warmly welcomed and felt like part of the family.  Barbara was always completely approachable and has a wealth of local knowledge. The suburb of Parkdale is a quiet residential area and this accommodation is a very convenient leisurely 5 minute walk to the train (which we didn't wait any longer than 7 minutes for!), local shops and cafes and at most a 10 minute walk to the beach.

A lot of thought has gone into making your visit enjoyable and comfortable, from fresh linen to a bar fridge in your room for convenience. 

Thank you Karen and Jim for the memorable stay."

I stayed at Diana‚Äòs for one night. I just needed a place for one night near the airport.

283257,63399672,2016-02-22,19288895,Richard,93,"I had a wonderful stay in Lulu's place. It's a unique apartment, set across multiple floors, open and spacy, with a top floor bedroom / bathroom that feels like you're in a treehouse. The apartment really has everything you need in terms of amenities. There's also a kind of enclosed balcony that is great for letting in light, and access to a lovely green garden. Likewise, location is brilliant: super close to lots of great cafes and bars in Fitzroy as well as lively Gertrude Street. And as a massive bonus, Lulu and her partner, Michael, are fantastic hosts: they were very communicative and helpful throughout - and even let me use a bike to get around during the week I was there. Would definitely stay here again."

We know Melbourne very well but for new tourists Judy has ample information to share.  The apartment is clean, comfortable and well located, and one is invited to eat breakfast out of her well-stocked kitchen.  All in all, a pleasant and modestly priced place to stay in Melbourne."
108032,125798947,2017-01-07,14917351,Richard,87,Malcolm was a great host very responsive and nothing too much hassle.

Highly recommend. Feels like you are at a retro summer camp, lovely atmosphere. Perfect location to the joys of Gertrude street. The bread/toast is fantastic-that really is all you need in between the delights of nearby cafes. Wonderful location that enabled easy access to all I needed to do and the shopping-I had to walk looking down for the last two days to avoid breaking my budget! "

The home is absolutely lovely and is ideally located in a trendy and interesting part of Melbourne.  We were waiting to move into our flat and were sad to leave the area and Susan's home.

Within  days of arriving at Susan's we felt we were friends with our host who is interesting and very easy to get along with.  We felt more like old friends visiting and not guests at a B and B.  It doesn't get better than that!"

67211,704966,2011-11-09,462145,Ricky,91,"A warm and gracious host who literally went the extra mile to make my stay a memorable and enjoyable one.
She has also printed a set of useful tips for her guests to refer to during their stay. 
Not only was the room airy and spacious, Wifi access was also available, with a printer ready for use.
She was also brimming with ideas on which are the more popular places to visit, and the modes of transportation.
As Kate's theme suggested, it's a tranquil and serene area. Peaceful and quiet.
It's definitely worth the 20-minute-long ride from Melbourne's Central Business District to Kate's residence."

Amazing location! Literally above one of Melbourne's best coffee shops (Dukes) and an abundance of cafes and restaurants within a 5 minute walk in all directions. Tram stop at the intersection and Flinders station is 2 minute walk. 

There is currently some ongoing construction noise from the new metro tunnel and on the weekend there is early morning street noise from clubs down the street. We were able to sleep through this but if you're a light sleeper this might affect you."

It is within a very short walking distance from the Melbourne Central Station, the Victoria markets, Chinatown and Melbourne city is either a tram ride or short walk away.  The bedroom was clean, comfortable and warm (Melbourne temperatures dropped suddenly in the two days I stayed at Sharyn's). The bathroom was very clean and very well stocked. As it is an old building, you would hear sounds at night as well as hear the noise from outside which is unavoidable given its very central location. But it was not a bother to me at all.  Sharyn was a very good host, very helpful, informative, easy to talk to and has a pleasant disposition and just a really lovely person. I really appreciate Sharyn accommodating me at extremely short notice. I would definitely stay at Sharyn's again.  18 April 2013"

I loved how Yulia did not have a set route and would make stops and take photos of each of us depending on our outfits and interest. It really takes a lot of talent to improvise like that. The tour pace was also great - it felt more like a leisurely stroll with a few friends, one who happens to be a professional photographer who speaks Japanese fluently and knows the area like the back of her hand. Yulia does this tour for fun in between her professional projects (i.e. photographing fashion and dancers), so catch her while you can!"

If you intend to bake cakes or roast dinners this is not the place as there is no kitchen, but a microwave, kettle and toaster are provided and there are heaps of great eating places nearby, so why bother?  Karen gladly provided for my need for gluten free provisions and all  that was provided was best quality.   Karen is a friendly and gracious host and you will enjoy staying at her accommodation."

The Kitchen is well supplied and very functional.
There is an extensive collection of DVDs and ipod docks in several rooms.
The pool is warm and relaxing, although quite heavily chlorinated! Don't spend too long underwater with your eyes open!!

Would definitely stay there again on another Melbourne visit, it is centrally located, functional and comfortable.

The apartment was clean and inviting, enough space for two adults and a baby and all the ammenities we needed for the week (including secure parking) were there. 
The building was quiet, private and easy to navigate, and surrounding area was funky and high-end. A great selection of cafes and restaurants, which Mia gave great advice and recommendations for. There is a small shopping centre close by with a supermarket and some specialty shops.
All in all we loved the apartment, its surroundings and Mia's wonderful hosting skills - we were so sad to leave and will definitely be back ASAP!"

189434,127077931,2017-01-15,4007367,Rob,92,"This place is in a perfect location to explore Melbourne. It's just 3 minutes walk to the tram stop and there are so many trams to CBD that you never have to wait. Carlton is great place and the main action area in Carlton is just one minute walk away. Hence why I'd say this location is perfect. 

We stayed for a whole month with our 3 year old son and the apartment worked well for us. It's small but perfectly formed. There isn't a huge amount of space in the apartment but the space has been really well designed. 

We ate breakfast and dinner at home every day so it was important to have a fully workable kitchen and this was just that. Big fridge, freezer and washing machine were important to us and it had all of these. 

The sofa bed is a comfortable sofa bed. I was worried that it would be a cheap and uncomfortable bed but this wasn't the case. I slept on it for 30 nights!

Sometimes at weekends there can be some noise outside from other local residents. This is less noisy in the bedroom as there is double glazing. Noisier for anyone sleeping on the sofa bed. Apartment is on the 2nd floor so wouldn't be suitable for anyone who struggles with stairs.   

Danielle and Ruth were very responsive to any questions we sent them via text message. 

Overall a great little place with a superb location. Highly recommended. "
74548,200143,2011-03-15,420439,Rob,100,"This was my first Airbnb experience and it far exceeded my expections! My room in Mario's apartment was on the 18th floor in a very well maintained high rise building in the heart of Melbourne. The views of the city from the livingroom balcony were terrific. Living in New York City I savor ""peace and quiet"" when I travel. My room was extremely peaceful and having my own private bathroom was a plus I never expected. In addition, Mario is very considerate and quiet(as quiet as a ""church mouse""), I never heard him coming in or going out once, it was like having the place all to myself. When I arrived Mario provided me with various tourist (Website hidden by Airbnb) obvoius he loves his city and wants you to enjoy it too. My only regret is that I didn't find his place sooner and stay longer. Also, since I was always out and about sightseeing and Mario had previous engagements we didn't have time to chat. Mario seems like a very interesting and caring person who is proud of his Italian heritage and family as noted in the many photos and momentos. If you are headed for Melbourne this is definitely the place to stay! Go and enjoy!  "

We highly recommend this accommodation and there is no doubt that when next in Melbourne we would hope to stay at Rebecca's Fabulous Fitzroy Apartment.  "

However, the problems with the room were multiple. Firstly, the room clearly had not been dusted in months. There were used condoms under the bed and underneath a cabinet. The amount of times the kitchen was tidy (ie. the space was useable and the sink was not full of dishes) could be counted on one hand. The bed was not a bed - rather, it was a futon that was incredibly uncomfortable to sleep on for more than one night. One morning I was confronted with a sink full of vomit - this had not been cleaned when I returned from work 8 hours later. A truly disappointing first Air BnB stay - I hope others in the future are not so negative."
43429,72712846,2016-05-04,67306793,Robert,91,"A peaceful little haven in Oakleigh East. A pleasant and clean studio with everything you need, including essential breakfast requisites for the first morning - even some little chocolate treats. We used the studio as a base for visiting family nearby so didn't spend a lot of time there to enjoy the peaceful garden. There was even an outdoor BBQ area we could have entertained a few guests! Convenient to main road and local shops, cafe etc a few doors away."

The cottage is just lovely and his Dog Jack was really nice to have around. The room was fantastic and very comfortable. Alan prepared tea and toast for me in the mornings and was great company. I loved being so close to downtown, easy to walk down and easy to get a street car back. I would to make another trip to Melbourne, and would definitely want to stay with Alan again, "
209073,11488329,2014-04-05,7680518,Robert,97,"Apartment: Very cool and stylish apartment at the nicer end of the city. The furnishings are really fun with cow skin rugs and great artwork. I stayed here for a month and was a great home away from home. 
Close to the best restaurants of Melbourne (chinchins, tonka, supper club, movida etc) and a beautiful tree lined road.
Oscar was such a good host, always available if I had any questions about Melbourne, really friendly and accommodating.

Linda is very sweet, her home is something very special and she has provided everything you will need. Port Melbourne is a short tram ride from the city so if you are in Melbourne, I would give this place a try."

252381,214145780,2017-11-25,19548026,Robert,92,"Terrific location.  Neat and comfortable.  Only downside for us was lack of good air conditioning in the over 30 degree temperatures we had for four days.  The portable air conditioner helped cool the apartment after arrival but was too noisy to leave on for too long and did little for the bedroom.
Would stay there again."

Thank You"
38271,31994748,2015-05-12,32186605,Robert,98,"The Good:
Quick replies and communication. My mother and aunty were kindly greeted into the property. The property was extremely tidy and there was bread, milk and other items in the kitchen awaiting. 

The Bad:
I would suggest that Daryl puts further details in his house rules around acceptance of smokers. I booked this property because it had an outdoor balcony and I know my mum  and aunty would want to pop outside for a smoke.  Unfortunately my mum and aunty felt a little uncomfortable doing this, following some questioning from the hosts. I booked this place to make my families visit as comfortable as possible and I would have chosen somewhere else if I would have known. 

With that said; The hosts were friendly, the beds were comfy, the house was clean and cosy.  Definitely recommended for non smokers. Great overall value. 

"

72576,23862429,2014-12-13,17418686,Robert,0,"This is a stunning home in a great location and Ramona is extremely nice.  At times it felt like we were in a hotel by the standard she treats her guests and her home.

Ramona is something of a collector and has a great eye for design, resulting in a home that you would expect to see in a magazine.

Ramona was also extremely communicative throughout our stay, keeping us informed of any new guests and her movements so that we always knew what to expect.

We had the pleasure of staying in both of her available rooms due to availability and we had a great stay in both!

This room is the whole of the top floor and has it's own balcony which is really nice.  The en-suite has a velux window in the shower making it light and airy and there's also a little study area where you can work overlooking the grand space that is the living room. 

Thanks Ramona."
50492,10032047,2014-01-27,9669496,Robert,97,Very nice unit close to the tram stop so very easy access to both downtown Melbourne and St. Kilda.  I was particularly impressed with how well the unit was decorated and we could feel right at home.

Vicki was awesome, She was a great and welcoming host and her rooms allowed for you to have personal yet not have a distancing solitary feel. The house was amazing, it was very clean and cozy.

Her townhouse is well laid out,clean and full of interesting pieces(love the weighing scales and blankets).I can highly recommend it as a place to stay.The water jug and flowers beside the bed were a lovely touch."
111001,131619831,2017-02-12,105759090,Robert Chase,93,"Was solid overall for a cute hotel lodging. Room was clean, front desk very accommodating with information and check-in was a breeze. Close walk to grocery and some delicious cafe/pizza spots. Only complaints were that the Wifi was not good, and didn't realize that 'kitchen closing at 8pm' meant one couldn't even access any food/drink in the refrigerator at all."

The breakfast provided was much appreciated and the options available quite good. 
Highlights? Perhaps the bed (slept like a log every time), the private bathroom and the shower (amazing water pressure), the couches in the living (so comfy I could have slept there) and the breakfast (for the reasons previously described).
Thanks a lot Chris!"
288147,1120789,2012-04-12,1937610,Roberto,90,I was extremely happy to stay @ Angel's Fab House. Angel is really friendly and makes you feel very welcome. I love her attention to detail and the house is warm and inviting. Very modern bathroom and a shower I can fit under (I am 6 foot 4 Inches (1.93 cm) which is a bonus. Nice to have a bath after a long day walking around the beautiful of Melbourne. She is a reasonable walk from the train station and there is often cabs nearby if you want. The train runs early into Southern Cross and quite frequently. Close to the airport and great value for money!

We loved our time in Michelle‚Äôs home and very much appreciated its privacy despite being in the thick of the action. This may be a spacious home with cathedral ceilings, but it is also intimate, warm, inviting and a great spot to unwind after a busy day of sightseeing, bar hopping and dining.

Her lovely home was just the same as the photos and I really enjoyed the views of Melbourne's city scape and the distant Dandenong Ranges.

I enjoyed the 5min walk beside parkland to a Korean restaurant which had fabulous food. "

The apartment is easily accessible from the city, but right away from the bustle of the city. I loved the quiet, the treelined streets, the sense of space, the view (it's on the 4th floor). The bed's really comfortable, and everything spotlessly clean. Gloria was friendly (like the cat!), helpful, interesting and easy to talk to, and clearly thrives on contact with air bnb'ers.

Diana is a very welcoming host and a wonderful, generous and lovely person. We really enjoyed eating and chatting together with her and Rob. If you go to Melbourne, you should strongly consider staying at Diana's place. We just loved it."
50492,208735200,2017-11-03,155012036,Rolf,0,"A very nice appartement in a quiet street of St. Kilda, very well equipped. Not far from the beaches and vibrant parts of the neighborhood."

41836,9065987,2013-12-03,10308986,Roman,98,Out stay at Diana's place was perfect! Although we haven't been much in the apartment we felt at home. The house is a bit further away from the city center but on the other hand its very quite and there is a train going close by! We tried to stay at Diana's a few days later but unfortunately she was booked! 
72576,234475437,2018-02-12,4884647,Roman,97,Truly a gem in the heart of Fitzroy. Ramona has an excellent feeling for design and people. The place gave us exactly what we needed. We would recommend it at any time! We already have booked our next stay.
72576,240948100,2018-03-07,4884647,Roman,98,"We don't stay at the same place often, but this place and Ramona are just extraordinary. Vintage style combined with modern touches. You have your privacy when needed and a nice living room to meet with other guests or Ramona. Highly recommended."
280698,219946340,2017-12-19,68198448,Romy,87,"I booked this place for my 70year old parents as their first Airbnb experience and they are now sold on this way of travel! Great location, near plenty of great eats, and yet quiet still. Everything was very easy for them! They would definitely recommend this place for anyone at any age."

288147,11129392,2014-03-22,12167627,Ron,94,I stayed with Angel for five weeks over summer. She is very hospitable and ensured I had everything I needed for my stay. Her place is clean and tidy with all the essentials and more. It is close to the airport and city with numerous dining and shopping options close by. Public transport is easily accessible at only a short walk. My room was cleaned and clean towels were provided regularly. Angel is very welcoming and sociable. In all a great host and would certainly stay there again. 
268849,106193637,2016-10-04,69193543,Ron,100,Mia was fantastic and kept me informed all the way. Great hostess. Highly recommended

313648,3077570,2012-12-12,4095969,Ronald,0,"Thanks Haydyn and Katrina the apartment was perfect, couldn`t have asked for anything more. Kitchen facilities were all new, though I only used the toaster, kettle and dishwasher-too busy eating out. But it was still nice to see an oven and gas if I had wanted to cook.  Broadband was fast, shower perfect, great location for the city too. Loved the historic houses in the street and nearby parks. Suprisingly cool despite the 30+ temperatures ouside! Great to have airconditioning option as well. It was also big enough for my 16 and 23 year old children plus very easy to clean when leaving."
108032,463244482,2019-06-03,261064141,Ronald,100,"This studio was very clean, stylish and very convenient in the heart of cbd, shopping and dining lanes and close to trams. Very cosy."

244952,3670238,2013-03-02,4835931,Ronwyn,70,Very convenient cute little apartment in a handy location. We parked our car in the space provided then walked everywhere. You have heard of the little cottage in the woods well this is the little apartment in the trees with a nice bath and basic cooking facilities  The bed is great and the lounge and dining furniture are serviceable. We would be happy to stay here again. Rebecca was easy to deal with and flexible with our uncertain check-in arrangements. I appreciated the art cards which sent us exploring in the city where we found the amazing jewellery gallery Funaki. Another thoughtful touch for visitors was a Miki card for the transport system and a map of the area.
268849,308653236,2018-08-17,59665149,Roong,0,This apartment was gorgeous. The building‚Äôs security was very good and I felt the neighborhood was safe and welcoming. The location was great as the room was located in a building that was about 3-5 minutes walk from the train station. It took me only 20 minutes or so by train and I was right in the middle of Melbourne CBD. The room was comfortable. The hosts were very responsive with my questions and very accommodating with me checking-in and checking-out. I would recommend this lovely room to all my friends and family coming to Melbourne. 
43429,214820,2011-04-01,463742,Rooth,95,"Allan's a top bloke and his place is really, really special. It's the kind of place that makes you want to hole up and stay in and not go out into Melbourne at all! Relaxing, peaceful, yet with an IGA express on the corner and a bus route into town; a tranquil garden and little travel treasures about the place, I'd love to return. Many thanks, lovely place. Rooth and Russell. "
62606,859054,2012-01-12,476328,Rory,0,"Room was fine and the atmosphere friendly. Once you work out the trains and buses it's relatively easy to come and go with a zone 1&2 ticket. When you get to Moorabbin Station get on a 211 or 212 bus but make sure it is going to ""Brighton"". ""Dandenong"" is the return bus going opposite direction."
72576,343213525,2018-10-31,216356912,Rosa,95,"Good Place to stay in Melbourne,near the City,clean and cozy. Ramona is very nice, precise and attentive. To be recommended"

There was a generous healthy offering of breakfast choices. Their local tips really gave me a head start on exploring Melbourne. 
Toni and her husband are great hosts who deserve 5 star + rating."
9835,46588875,2015-09-12,26184717,Rosalind,94,I was visiting Melbourne to spend time with my son and daughter-in-law and their new baby but I needed accommodation. I was very pleased to find Manju‚Äôs house only 20 minutes walk away. Manju was a kind host and her lovely house is spacious and the bed very comfortable. Being able to watch tv upstairs was a bonus too. The house is in a pleasant neighbourhood and only a short walk to the bus stop. The bus takes a fast route into the city on the freeway which was a nice surprise.
150729,7166768,2013-09-09,8023689,Rosalind,100,"Perfectly positioned in Fitzroy: a very quick walk to cafes, to designer one-off boutiques, and brilliant bookshops. But it's far enough away from the vibrancy when you need quiet. Bed was comfy with good cotton sheets. Everything is clean and  decorated with an artistic eye. 
I had the lower level front room; has anyone else crouched down low to be able to closely observe the tiny shy little Button Quail that scratch around in the patch of garden on the other side of the long window?
The 86 tram is so handy: South to Chinatown, the city centre and Docklands, or North to Thornbury and La Trobe Uni.
Ramona is a delightful and genuine host. Gracious, generous and very thoughtful. I really enjoyed and appreciated my stay. 
Thank you Ramona."
150729,404940029,2019-01-25,56506589,Rosalind,98,"Spacious, clean, comfortable, well equipped and quirky. My nine nights in Fitzroy we‚Äôre perfect. Thanks Ramona"
310594,5965194,2013-07-24,2444652,Rosalyn,0,"Bridget's apartment is a wonderful place to stay and base yourself in Melbourne. The location in Abbotsford is quiet and so close to many things in all directions, everything you could need all within walking distance. The apartment itself is not only clean and comfortable but an interesting home that is obviously loved. The views of the trees (especially from the bed) are such a treat, you almost forget how close you really are to the city. As for Bridget, she's responsive, organized, very accommodating and simply a nice person to deal with, I couldn't recommend her and her apartment more. (And a mention for Jerome from the florist/little cafe around the corner, great coffee, great flowers, very friendly!)"

We stayed on the top floor ensuite which was spacious and clean and very comfortable and welcoming ! 
Ramona as a host is warm and helpful . You will have everything you need . She is respectful of your privacy and is very considerate. 
The kitchen is fully equipped and there are always delicious aromas of fresh muffins and seeded breads and a wealth of teas for breakfast ! 
The laundry is great and accessible ! she also has a lovely selection of DVD s which she generously  shares 
The location is absolutely perfect for easy access to Melbourne CBD but apart from that I loved being in the trendy suburb of Fitzroy with its wealth of cafe's , bookshops , boutiques with my very favorite art shop ST LUKE'S being around the corner in Smith street ! 
All I all I would highly recommend little George street . 
Thank you Ramona ! "

161033,63568790,2016-02-24,7034090,Rosemary,100,"I was so glad when I finally arrived at Karen's place, I had been to a wedding in Dixons Creek and had to be there by 2pm for 4pm wedding which didn't finis until 11.30pm. As I was coming from Rosedale in Gippsland and didn't know the area I got lost a few times but couldn't make it to Karen's before the wedding. 
Luckily Karen had texted me to tell me how to get to her place and watch out for kangaroos. 
Lovely cottage in beautiful gardens, comfortable bed and quiet which I needed had a great nights sleep. Good pressure in shower and had a cup of tea the next morning. Busy day had to be home by 11am and on leaving the cottage I could appreciate the beautiful gardens in the morning. 
Very restful place and thank you Karen. "
47100,14086749,2014-06-11,14572233,Rosemary,0,"Loren's apartment was exactly how she described - clean, decorative and welcoming. It's the perfect location to stay in for a short or long trip as Richmond has some great places to eat and shop and is only a 10 minute tram ride to the city. 
Loren was amazing as a hostess, she was extremely prompt with her emails and made sure everything was right for my stay. It was my first time using airbnb and she ensured that I didn't have anything to worry about. 

Highly recommend the apartment as a place to stay! "
76867,5786462,2013-07-16,3060908,Rosemary,100,"This apartment is close to everything..city centre, South Melbourne, trams, botanical gardens, cycle paths, St Kilda, Albert Park, Arts Centre. If you want to be in the middle of Melbourne and enjoy walking everywhere, this is for you. If not, there are plenty of trams and buses.
Judy is warm, welcoming and generous and is willing to help in whatever manner possible. The bed was extremely comfy and warm, and there is very little road noise from the busy street below. There is a separate bathroom, with washing and drying facilities available.There are many little touches which make this more than a room to stay."

The apartment feels like a home, and the hosts go out of their way to make sure guests enjoy their stay.  We were especially appreciative of their help when we inadvertently locked ourselves out! 
An exceptional airbnb experience in a world class city."

The apartment is a good size for two, the bed is comfy and with the windows shut there is minimal noise. There isn‚Äôt air con but we were more than comfortable with the fans on. Location is great, with several tram stops nearby going into the city or down to South Yarra. There‚Äôs also a train station but that was quite a walk for us so we didn‚Äôt do it often. There‚Äôs a cafe on the corner of the street which serves good coffee and breakfast options, would recommend going there!"

Would recommend them to anybody traveling to Melbourne, St Kilda. "

We stayed two weeks and were very comfortable. We have no hesitation in recommending it. Hoang is concerned about noise from her apartment above - it didn't worry us at all. You can hear foot steps when the family arrives home and gets up in the morning - all ok with us. "
331605,13337520,2014-05-26,5485109,Roslyn,93,We were a group of six and found the apartment very comfortable.  Dina was very responsive to requests.  Would stay there again when in Melbourne.

67211,875935,2012-01-22,843495,Roy,98,I enjoyed the time I spent at Kate's apartment. The whole experience was first class from start to finish. Kate made me feel comfortable from the time I walked through the door. The bedroom was suitably furnished with  the use of a laptop. Kate made me very comfortable and was very easy to talk to.. The location is in a very nice area and very close to the tram stop which takes you straight into the heart of Melbourne.
74959,7642802,2013-09-28,7687037,Roy,100,"I stayed with Linda Loose in her lovely townhouse for a week, and it was a total success. Linda is an amazing and amusing host. The house is even better than in the photos, and it is located in a really good position for visitors. It is perhaps 100 yards from the beach, which stretches into the distance for miles. It is about 5 minutes away from the Port Melbourne  tram stop that goes every 6-12 minutes to the CBD; and 15 minutes in the other direction is the South Melbourne Beach tramstop to the other side of town, galleries etc. Inbetween there is Bay Street with shops, and many cafes and restaurants.
In summary, this is a tremendous place for a temprary home, either for business or tourism. Unqualified recommendation!"

Raewyn was a perfect host and looked after us extremely well.
We would have no hesitation in recommending her to friends who may wish to have a short stay in Melbourne."

50492,23792716,2014-12-10,16224489,Roy,92,"This place was simply amazing. 10/10 the apartment was very close to the CBD only a 10min tram ride away. Although it looks a bit small it honestly did not feel that way at all, even the neighbours were very nice when we would run into them on our way out in the mornings. Just down the road about 2mins is a Woolies 3 tram stops and even a train station. It is beautifully furnished and supplied for and is everything you would want in an AirBnB place. Although we never actually got to meet the hosts, they had sent very clear and easy instructions on everything you could possibly ask., they were also extremely nice and ruthlessly efficient, every time we would message them we would receive a polite reply within the hour, honestly amazing I can't wait to stay here again when I'm back in Melbourne."

We hope to stay here  again. Our hosts were quietly delightful and unobtrusive. The air conditioned  unit is small but tasteful and has everything we needed from the nice but small bathroom and kitchen. A fabulous bonus is the huge  outdoor covered deck area with a nice dining table and bbq, plus a pleasant view into a grassed area and small fish pond. Flowers everwhere. A gem of a spot.

The tastefully decorated bedroom, private bathroom and the rest the house are very clean and well kept. The level of cleaness and overall quality is equivalent to that of a 4 or 5 star hotel.

The location is within 5 minutes walk to the lovely port Melbourne beach. There are nearby cafes just down the street and around the tram station.

Going to downtown Melbourne from the accommodation is straight forward thanks to the nearby tram.

Linda's kindness and hospitality is what made my stay uniquely pleasant. She made me feel at home and was extremely helpful from the day I arrived. Linda provided me with her very kind support even after my departure by helping me with logistics and luggage.

Last but not least, Buff the dog is one of the most well behaved and fun dogs that I hangout with. Its a great fun to have him around.

Thank you so much dear Linda for your wonderful hospitality and hope to see you again soon.

The location is great too, in a lovely old parkland area but near great shops and cafes but an easy tram ride into the CBD.  The bedroom is lovely with a super comfy bed and cosy quilt and the private bathroom is fab.

However, what really makes Gloria's apartment a great place to stay is Gloria herself. She couldn't have been more welcoming. I had a job interview by (Hidden by Airbnb) within hours of arriving and she made sure I was relaxed (as far as possible) and that we had everything we needed. It was lovely to chat over breakfast on a wide variety of topics.  We hope very much to return to Melbourne and when we do we would very much like to stay with Gloria again."

The house is sooo beautiful that one would like to spend time at home unfortunately ours was a short trip but else we are sure Ryan would have loads of travel stories and perhaps helped plan another travel to one of the countries her has been to.

He also helped us plan the ocean drive, and gave awesome recommendation on ""must do's"" and ""can skip""

Cheers

310594,105742215,2016-10-02,4653747,Sally,99,"Bridget's apartment is delightful. It is a true artist residence with quirky spaces, artwork, books to read , excellent natural light and interesting city outlooks. It is a quiet laneway and gives you access to Three Bags Full . We enjoyed breakfasts there with extended family which were fabulous. Victoria street offers a range of Asian cuisine but is a little grimy with a strong drug culture. We caught the 109 tram in and out of the city from here."

67211,3518853,2013-02-11,760681,Sally,99,"I enjoyed my stay with Kate very much. Kew is a very pleasant  suburb to stay in and is close to the CBD of Melbourne.   The flat is cute, sparkling clean and very secure.    The room is as shown and  everything you need is provided,  including bedding and towels.   Kate is very accommodating and helpful -  a really lovely host. I felt very comfortable and relaxed from the first day of my stay.   The are a few flights of stairs but this also means you have a  nice view from the lounge room balcony.     I  highly recommend Kate's place and I would definitely stay again. Thanks Kate! "

283257,215310190,2017-11-29,2330676,Sally,40,"Ok so this place is amazing!  First of all I can‚Äôt say enough about how fantastic Lulu  and Michael are.  They are kind, caring, and from the minute you step inside it feels like you are part of the neighborhood.  The house is cozy and comfortable, a real home away from home.  The location is pretty much perfect, you have access to anything you could possibly want within a few blocks walk, but when you decide to retire at the house it‚Äôs always quiet, relaxed, and peaceful.  The bottom line is, the people are amazing, the house is fantastic, and the location is perfect, and this is where you want to stay."
277605,65681779,2016-03-16,61046119,Sally,96,Our hosts welcomed us warmly and also surprised us with a special movie treat. The cottage was beautifully prepared and stocked with all kinds of goodies and flowers! Any need or request was immediately addressed.

Great !"
76867,16799282,2014-08-02,18387042,Salonie,93,"This was my first AirBnB experience. Judy's place was about 20-25 mins away from the Airport. She was home when we arrived and showed us the place with a smile. The room had a lovely view - the hustle and bustle of the city roads and tall buildings which looked really pretty at night. One could also see the beach. There were binoculars to enjoy a better view.  The bed was really comfortable too. She's kept the place really clean. 
Although she's really particular about the check out (Website hidden by Airbnb) must keep in mind!

Overall I had a pleasant stay at Judy's apartment."
363278,3852629,2013-03-21,4665860,Salvador,92,"My stay at Alan's place has been a great experience. Alan has been an amasing host, his attention to detail, kindness and generosity have made of my stay in Melboune a memoable one,"
74548,22977867,2014-11-19,11629885,Salvatore,0,"Mario was very responsive by mail and txt and assured me that early check in was no problem, even though I arrived as early as 9 am. On arrival, Mario gave me the key and told me to make myself at home, because he had to leave for work. Imagine that, opening your house to a complete stranger and trusting him to be alone in your house from the very beginning. But that's Mario, the best host ever!
When he came back from work he offered to show me around the city and we went for a walk. We had dinner together and a nice chat, and I felt at home away from home. What more can you ask for?
The room is not too spacious, but the bed is comfortable, there is a wardrobe with coathangers provided, and the shower in the ensuite bathroom is fantastic. Mario also provides essentials and plenty of towels. 
The neighbours are very quiet, so no problem to get a good sleep at night. In the morning you can hear a bit of the traffic, but we're in the city after all. And then Mario likes to get up to some good music, which you might enjoy or not.
You can use the kitchen, the washing machine the iron, everything you need for a long stay.
The tram station RMIT is right at your doorstep and Mario even provides a Myki, so you can make use of it from the very first day, which is very convenient.
In one word: fantastic!"

Adam was super friendly and communicative and its on a quiet street in one of the best suburbs of Melbourne. Hard to beat!"
47100,3561633,2013-02-17,835298,Sam,80,Although she wasn't there Loren was an excellent host. We felt welcome in her home and spent an enjoyable few days there. The location is good and the apartment itself is lovely. I would definitely recommend it to others.

10803,348444786,2018-11-13,145498403,Sam,98,"Cleanliness is an issue. Dust, clutter and rarely an empty sink or hob not with leftover food on it... for days on end. Dishes, cutlery and cooking utensils will probably always need to be cleaned prior to use. You will be requested not to spend longer than 5 minutes in the shower, on multiple occasions. And can be a dark and dinghy place as blinds and curtains are regularly closed. It is right outside a tram stop which is convenient but also noisy at night, also opposite a pub, which plays live/loud music on weekends which could be a problem if looking for an early night... some earplugs will do the trick and probably why there were a few still under the bed from previous guests.
Having said this, if you are happy eating out, not looking to spend much time in the flat and just looking for a cheap bed/private room in a good location then this is a good place to stay. The location is great. Cool old style apartment but needs a good professional clean and tidy up."

I am sad that I had such a busy schedule, so we did not manage to catch up much, but cannot recommend this place more: it was very comfortable to stay in, tidy, convenient, and really nice. Nothing to improve. It was impeccable. Thank you so much Mario!"

She is very experienced in hosting and the rooms are well equipped and comfortable with good beds, nice outlooks and things like desks and hanging space. It's an absolutely brilliant place to stay in Melbourne if you are wanting the airbnb experience and I had lots of lovely conversations with Karen and her family who are  warm and welcoming people. I would definitely recommend Karen's place and Karen and her husband Jim as hosts! Thanks for such a great time:)"
47100,3967558,2013-03-31,3623015,Sam,93,"Loren & Ruth are absolutely the most delightful human beings, and spectacular hosts to boot. Their flat is a) adorable, b) full of everything you could possibly need to facilitate your visit to Melbourne and c) located minutes away from vast quantities of food, coffee and shopping, as well as tram lines to take you wherever you need to go. The room is cozy and comfortable, and they have all the kitchen gadgets & spices you could want if you're into cooking your own meals. They're both full of knowledge about the city, & their recommendations for food were always top notch. Loren & Ruth are just the cutest, funniest, most lovely people I've come across in Melbourne, and they also went out of their way and presented me with a delicious little chocolate cake on my birthday. What more can I say? Stay with these guys! You'll have the best time, I promise."
74548,4268160,2013-04-23,5313733,Sam,80,"Mario... is the super host. Say no more! He knows everything and everyone in Melbourne. If you're looking for an ideally located and friendly place to stay where you can really get in with the locals... look no further.

Had a wonderful 2 weeks sharing with him during the Melbourne Comedy Festival.

All the best Mario. Cheers, Sam"
43429,407658296,2019-02-02,162992656,Sam,82,Quiet location with a small grocery store and cafe walking distance and about 10min drive from chadstone shopping centre! Host Allan was approachable and friendly. Place is great fit for 1 to 2 people with appropriate house appliances!
297350,343225886,2018-10-31,145498403,Sam,60,"Ryan and Rhiannon are awesome hosts, friendly, welcoming, and invite you to treat the place like your own. The house is spotless, with a really nice design and an unimaginable amount of pretty incredible souvenirs from their travels all over the world, if this interests you Ryan is more than willing to give you a guided tour of them and the backstories of where they came from and the meaning/use behind them. I don't know that he'd want me saying this but he's also willing to give some free accommodation in exchange for some help around the house, which I found to be very helpful on keeping costs down! 

If like me, you are arriving in Australia from another country, this is an excellent place to settle and gather your bearings with everything you need in house and in local proximity, a bus stop right opposite the house which takes you directly to the train station and into the city, all in around 45mins-1hour (and even shorter on return as some stops are left out) If this sounds long I can assure you it doesn't feel it! I was initially worried about the distance to the city but having lived here for over a week (having extended from initial 7 days) I am now considering staying more long term as the commute doesn't bother me at all and I love living here, not to mention how cheap it is! 

Couldn't recommend it enough!"
76867,1654148,2012-07-08,724536,Sam,93,"Second time at Judy's, I've noticed there is a lot of commentary about the comfort of the bed. It's true! After traveling for 6 months you learn to appreciate a comfortable bed and pillows! Thanks again Judy."
75109,61093937,2016-01-31,54894564,Sam,85,"Staying with Karen, Jim and their fantastic family was the perfect way for my six year old daughter and I to finish our eight day adventure on the road.
Because I had my little girl with me, it was a no brainer staying in this beautiful home situated in a very quiet and safe neighbourhood, yet so close to the city. 
It was easy to get around and sightsee. We did have a car but public transport is close and easy.
Karen was very accommodating. The room was ideal, very neat and clean and I appreciated the cold drinks waiting for me in a small bar fridge within the room. Just what I needed after a long drive!
It was a pleasure to meet the entire family as well as some of their friends that happened to be there one evening. We had a beer and some fun, easy going conversation while the kids made friends and played. I couldn't ask for more! I felt right at home. 
No issues what so ever with the children and noise. By night, the home was calm and quiet, I slept like a log.
If ever in Melbourne, I'll be sure to stay here again.
Thank you Karen and Jim!"

Being a local, I can vouch that this is one of the best spots in Melbourne for a tourist in terms of accessibility and convenience to all the great sights Melbourne has to offer. 

Hope to stay with you again Judy on the return leg!"

Right on Collins Street and a stones throw from all the main action. Apartment was wonderful, full amenities and great place to rest your head after a day of walking.  Malcolm was a great host, even bought us a bottle of champers as it was our wedding anninversay, we felt very welcome.  Keep in mind that you are in the heart of the CBD so you will experience some noise, not a great deal, but if you are a light sleeper and sensitive to the sounds of the city, then bring some earplugs."

268849,26991598,2015-02-23,9623912,Samantha,97,"Mia's apartment is as stunning as the photos look. It's the perfect size for two, cosy but not claustrophobic. We didn't spend too much time in the apartment as we were sight-seeing a lot but it was lovely to be able to come home to a nice place at the end of the day. Random points to note:

The couch is really comfortable! I actually fell asleep on it once. 
The bed is quite high as well and supports well (I have a sensitive back). 
The balcony was a nice place to sit and look out even though there was a construction view.
The cafe downstairs is great as is Zumbo's right next door.
The train station is literally two minutes away and a two stop journey brings you into the city.
Mia is awesome, she let us in even when it was almost 10 pm due to our late flight + delays and made no complaints. She hung around to give us pointers as well. Every time we had questions she would reply immediately. 

My only one comment is that the bedroom got quite hot in summer with no fan and with everything being black. Leaving the door open and the window (slightly open) helped though. 

I highly recommend a stay here."
268849,55975710,2015-12-07,49983455,Samantha,89,Mia's appartment looked just like the photos! Very clean and welcoming. The location is incredibly convenient with the trainstation just a short walk away I would definitely stay here again!

The apartment is really spacious and our two year old and four year old settled in right away!  Good location with easy access to trams to get to the beach and only a short walk to shops, cafes and parks.  Facilities in the apartment are great and it's really set up for families.

331605,17815404,2014-08-18,12711189,Samara,100,"Unfortunately the booking information that was emailed to me prior to my stay was inaccurate with the wrong tower listed as where the accommodation was. A quick phone call to the help desk rectified this situation. However the accommodation wasn't what was pictured in the advertisement with the concierge confirming that it was a new apartment listed. The apartment was mostly ok, however not an executive apartment. The dish towels were stained and dirty, and carpet looked tired. The balcony windows were very dirty and smeared.

The location was excellent and perhaps some attention to the detail of presentation would improve the experience for others. "

A beautiful little house in Fitzroy with 2 bedrooms and 2 bathrooms. lulu was really welcoming and went to the added extras of making sure we had transport cards and maps. Really artsy and among lots of trees I felt like I was in a treehouse or a little getaway. Located in Fitzroy it was amongst lots of great shops and cafes and a short 15-20 minute walk to the cbd. The iron stopped working while we were there and they had us a new one that day. Highly recommended!

268849,185872200,2017-08-23,9474450,Sammy,100,Mia's home is super stylish & perfectly positioned between Chapel Street & South Yarra metro station. Her professional experience with being an airbnb host really shows through accurate description of her apartment & prompt communication. Mia was so caring to give us very detailed instructions for check in as our flight arrived quite late. She stayed up to make sure we got safely to her home. Upon check out she was also very kind to help arrange to store our luggage as we had a late departure flight. We really enjoyed the easy access to many great cafes & restaurants in the neighbourhood & the city was just a short tram or train ride away. Thank you once again Mia for being a fantastic host!!
72576,125631640,2017-01-06,25656093,Sammy,98,"Ramona's place is absolutely wonderful! Every element of the house's decoration and furnishings are quirky, interesting and awesome. Ramona went out of her way to ensure our room was ready early even though she wasn't in Melb at the time - she had a friend prep the room especially. Amazing location, right around the corner from Fitzroy's great bars, restaurants and shops. Ramona had some great recommendations and was full of knowledge about the local area. Definitely will stay here again - I miss Little George already! "
268849,90651055,2016-08-01,13766599,Samual,98,"Mia was most welcoming even though we got in for the airport after 11pm at night! She let us into the apartment and showed us where everything was. The apartment is as luxurious and stylish as it appears in the photos and has an excellent bed and great rainfall shower (worth lots of bonus points)! The location is also superb - less than 5 minutes walk from South Yarra train station which provides easy access to the city and also a short walk to the famous Chapel Street and Prahran Market. 

Mia was a superb host who had many suggestions of places to see and eat both close to the apartment and in the city. She made our stay very easy and very comfortable."

Muy c√≥modo y puede acomodar hasta una tercera persona ya que cuenta con sof√° retractable, definitivamente me hospeder√≠a de nueva cuenta en el apartamento.   Puede ser que no provea con amenidades b√°sicas como pastillas para la lavajillas, jab√≥n para los platos o para limpiar los pisos pero solo basta con ped√≠rselos a la persona que limpia."

The house is not a flashy property, but it is located in a superb area of Melbourne close to the beaches, transport and shopping. Everything works in the house and the lounge room with the big TV was a very pleasant place to spend the evening hours. Value for money?  You bet ...."
268849,102951753,2016-09-19,12929908,Samuel,0,Mia's flat was exactly as it seemed; super swanky and the perfect little urban retreat. Amazing for a couple spending a few days in this sophisticated city. We had everything we needed and an awesome view. The apartment was a short train ride to central Melbourne so is in a great location. We would highly recommend Mia's apartment to anyone looking to spend some time in beautiful Melbourne!

She is very considerate and lovely, always ready to help.

From the beginning, she gave us a lot of useful information. Before our arrival, she reminded us our trip and asked more information about us in order to offer us greater stay.

Four days in Mel, the most remembering place was Ramona's house. 
Her house is our dream house. You will have the same feeling when you get there.

The surrounding area is full of nice cafe and restaurant. The location of the house is convenient to everywhere and for everything. Everything is in walking distance.

The room is spacious and you will have everything you need. We are pretty sure you will linger over the beauty of the painting, the amazing collection of blankets, maps, mirrors and so on.

We highly recommend Ramona to you without any reservation."

The room is beautifully set up with everything you could need.  The bed was super comfortable and the room had a whole range of information on Melbourne, right down to tram timetables and a MYKI card.  The toilet is right beside the bedroom which is handy and the shower on the same level.  The house had everything I needed and was warm, cozy and comfortable.  Would highly recommend!!"
297350,25815922,2015-01-26,22477432,Samuel,99,"Very nice host and brand new facilities, really value for money.
For those travelling on public transport, a bus stop is right in front of the house. The bus will take you to a nearby train station, and the you may travel to the downtown. It seems far away from city on the map, but as long as you check the bus and train timetable or use the Victoria Journey Planner website, you will be able to reach  downtown Melbourne within an hour."

74959,11128104,2014-03-22,4062597,Sandie,99,"We loved living in Port Melbourne where we had the best of both worlds.  From your front door just turn right and you are a two minute stroll from the beach, the boardwalk and the best Italian breakfast in town.  Turn left and you can see the bright lights of the Central Business District, just a short tram or bus ride away.  Linda was a most generous host; warm and friendly and open, keen to help us enjoy Melbourne and encouraging us to feel at home in her beautiful house. We could not have done better. We should have stayed longer."

The apartment is very nice and luxurious even, the furniture and facilities are modern and beautiful. It is a bit of a journey by tram between the city center and the apartment (~40min), but the tram stop is conveniently positioned just across the street.
I would definitely recommend Daniela's home to anyone!"
74959,888125,2012-01-29,1261339,Sandra,100,"Linda is an excellent host.  She is so knowledgeable about everthing ""Melbourne"" (and all of Australia for that matter), and gave us such good information when we were planning our many activities. The location is fabulous!  Downtown Melbourne is a quick tram ride away and seemingly endless beaches are 1/2 a block down the street.  Shopping and restaurants are also within walking distance.  We loved every minute of our stay and hope to return again."

The top bedroom feels like being in a bird's nest amongst the backyard trees. Lulu made me very welcome and I will return with pleasure next time I am in Melbourne."
74548,7959057,2013-10-10,6750377,Sandra,93,"Mario is a very nice guy I very much enjoy living with. I`m living with him for almost 2 month - now it is half time - and there is not a single issue I could report. He gives advices for toursistic activities and things to do in Melbourne and drove me around Melbourne in the beginning. The apartment is great and very central. The room comes along with a seperate bathroom, so there is no conflicts in usage. You can use the kitchen including the fridge to cook, the discounter ALDI is just next door. If you have nothing to do in the evening you can join Mario watching TV - a very enjoyable experience :) 
Mario`s Place is well suitable for women - so give it a try girls ;) If someone has more questions just leave me a message!"

We had our privacy but at the same time enjoyed to use the second floor and have a chat with our lovely host. Ramona gave us the warm and friendly feeling of staying at home. And as she asked me what I liked most while we stayed in melbourne I could only answer: the people! Thanks to Ramona: Our time @ Little George Street was awesome!
P.S.: In addition to the wonderful atmosphere the house is perfectly designed and equipped. There is nothing you would ever miss..."

The apartment was spacious, clean, very well equipped and stocked with everything that we needed during our 8 night stay.  Daryl and Deanna really made us feel most welcome and at home in what is essentially their backyard and they were so very helpful during our stay and even afterwards. I would really recommend this accommodation to anyone without thinking twice. Thanks Daryl en Deanna for being such lovely hosts !  We really loved staying in the apartment. "

He took our little group around Chinatown and taught us a bunch of different things on how to get better photographs/different photographs. This was definitely a great experience for beginners and amateurs (and I'm sure more experienced photographers as well). Jerry encouraged the class to shoot in manual and even though I was only armed with an iPhone, I was still able to learn from Jerry (tip: download an iPhone app that gives you the ability to shoot in ""manual"" on the iPhone).

Chris was away when we first arrived so we didn't see him for a few days. Also we were busy in the lead up to our son's wedding. We made up for lost time however chatting about cycling, photography etc.
Chris was a brilliant host, providing us with yummy breakfasts ( even in his absence) and ensuring we were very comfortable and had all we needed. He ran the extra mile by taking us on a little tour of the area so Ray could get good photographs and even dropped us off at the Airbus depot the morning we left, bless him. That made such a difference as we had a lot of luggage.
Thanks so much Chris!"

The king-size bed is fabulous, the retro bathroom clean with large, fluffy towels provided. And breakfast! A large choice of teas, cereals, yogurts, fresh bread & pastries was a highlight.

The place is in a secured block and the neighbourhood is lively and safe too. Julie pre-warmed my room on arrival and everything I needed was there. I wasn't sure if I would have a company so her flexible offer was just perfect for me. I couldn't share much time with her but when I did I very much enjoyed her knowledge in the area and experiences. I would stay there again.

She'll leave you to your own device as much as you like, but is a wealth of local knowledge, especially when it comes to the best  pubs. The house itself is immaculate, light and beautifully styled. The bed is comfortable and shower nice and hot. Location wise, there is so much on your doorstep and the CBD is a short tram ride or medium walk away.

150729,278820835,2018-06-19,19263074,Sarah,60,"Had a great time staying at Ramona's place! The location is perfect for the urban explorer. Nestled at a point in Fitzroy that's close walking distance to public transport, all the streets and shops Fitzroy is known for, while also being on a quiet and cozy street. Ramona provides all sorts of suggestions and guidebooks for your stay. She is also a warm and friendly host who is the reason I like using Airbnb! I will definitely be staying here when I come back to Melbourne!"
150729,90179819,2016-07-31,10202083,Sarah,98,"I had a fantastic stay at Little George. the house was the perfect landing spot for my first two weeks living in Melbourne. Ramona was a wonderful, friendly and very helpful host. The house was clean, spacious and beautifully decorated with a cozy and comfortable bedroom. The location is perfect for anyone wanting to explore Fitzroy with so many cafes, bars and restaurants nearby and only a short tram ride to the city. I would 100% recommend for anyone looking to stay in Melbourne. "
111001,215136030,2017-11-27,28001760,Sarah,100,I had a really nice Morning with Yulia and 4 other Persons. Yulia showed us some hidden gems in Harajuku. I rediscovered this part of Tokyo! I‚Äôm looking forward to see the pictures. 
263871,106357511,2016-10-05,6403387,Sarah,100,"I stayed in Eliisa's apartment whilst I was visiting the Victoria State Library and had a really pleasant stay. This apartment is spacious, central and well-equipped. Eliisa communicated well with me about checking in and out, and was easily contactable when I had questions. The flat feels cosy and like someone has really thought about all of the things you need to live there. Work on the new plaza across the street meant the flat could get a bit noisy during the day on weekdays but this ceased well before I was wanting to head to bed. Good internet, a very safe building, a clean apartment and a lovely street to stay on. I would very much recommend this flat, particularly for business travellers working in the city centre. "

Such a high standard of care I would never stay any where else when visiting Melbourne. 
Highly recommend."
76867,94698049,2016-08-16,78100378,Sarah,89,"Judy is fabulous, her instructions on how to get there, where to go and key drop were spot on.  It was my first time using Air BnB and could not have asked for anything more.  Comfortable bed own bathroom and very clean would highly recommend and looking forward to staying again.  Thank you Judy for your warm hospitality. :)"
76867,10125217,2014-02-01,11610503,Sarah,100,"Judy's place is perfectly located in the heart of South Melbourne, with great transport links to the city. The apartment is clean and tidy with plenty of privacy, but Judy also gave me a warm welcome and made me feel at home. A great place to stay if you want the freedom to come and go as you please whilst also having your own space. Thanks Judy!"
161033,248587421,2018-03-31,75351599,Sarah,100,"Karen's little cottage was very nice and peaceful, if you are looking for a weekend getaway from the city life, that's exactly what we've been spoiled with. Tall trees, open spaces and no ones around you, nice. Karen gave us lots of space so we felt we were the only people there, the cottage was small but cosy. We had breakfast on the veranda, it was nice. We would loved if there is WiFi and a small BBQ so we could stay in and not havibg to worry about going to a restaurant. But overall it was value for money and a nice place to stay when you are touring Healesville regions."
12936,124003551,2016-12-31,15313020,Sarah,90,"L'appartement est magnifique et tr√®s agr√©able. Il est id√©alement bien plac√© car la plage, les transports et le supermarch√© √† c√¥t√©. "

The house was perfect for our needs, close to the township and shops, but also in a very tranquil setting. The large main room and balcony are perfect for relaxing and the bedroom and ensuite bathroom were nice and clean."
47100,168339,2011-01-09,48830,Sarah,96,Loren and Ruth are fantastic hosts and have a wonderful little place in very fun Richmond. We enjoyed using it as a base to explore the rest of the city!
150729,2590832,2012-10-12,3286138,Sarah,100,"Lovely & modern place, comfortable bedroom, and Ramona was such a gracious and helpful host. Location in the Fitzroy neighborhood is fantastic as well - plenty of pubs, restaurants, hip stores, etc. within walking distance and good access to public transportation."

283257,234727147,2018-02-13,5334012,Sarah,80,"Lulu is the hostess with the mostest! Don‚Äôt miss the opportunity to stay in her lovely apartment. It is very well located, charming and clean, right in the heart of Fitzroy and steps away from a variety of wonderful restaurants and great shops! I have stayed in many Airbnb‚Äôs and Lulu has been by far the most open, accommodating and friendly hostess; she took a great deal of time to explain to us where to find the gems of Melbourne, responded quickly to any questions we may have had and welcomed us with some lovely munchies! Thank you Lulu for making our stay in Melbourne so easy and wonderful, we hope to see you again soon!"
283257,198902400,2017-10-01,8736006,Sarah,99,"Lulu‚Äôs home is the best of two worlds - one quiet and residential, one lively and active. Our house was down a quiet street two blocks away from some of the best shops and restaurants Fitzroy has to offer. Walking distance to the CBD and easy access to the trams (even easier with the transport cards Lulu gave us!). Seriously such a special place, we loved it so much. Thank you lulu!!!"
108032,112349238,2016-11-05,73866870,Sarah,100,"Malcolm's apartment was in a fantastic location for us. Malcolm was also incredibly welcoming and helpful, offering lots of great suggestions for things to do while we were in the city.

We loved staying at this apartment, and would be delighted to do so again in the future."
38271,629550,2011-10-15,539931,Sarah,95,"My partner and I have come to Australia on a long term basis, and wanted a good solid start base to begin our emigration. Before we even arrived in Australia, Deanna and Daryl were so helpful in giving us information about where to get hire cars, possible rental homes, things we may need to make our transition easier. We didn't know the couple before this trip, but they felt like long lost friends before our plane even landed. They weren't just giving us a room, they have been like a second family to us. Also, their apartment was so clean and fresh, it has just been totally renovated so felt like we were in a hotel. Deanna and Daryl made us feel so welcome, even down to the little touches like putting cadburys chocolate on our beds for our arrival, and stocking us up with the basics in the fridge to help us start out. Their place is quite far from the city, but that is the only down side (and a minor one at that), but not a problem if you hire a car, which we found better as we got to see more of Melbourne that way, plus we could drive to a nearby park that had wild kangaroos!!!!!!!! You don't get that in the city! So if you want to stop somewhere warm, friendly and inviting then this is the place to choose. You will never feel on your own, and if you ever need to know anything, Deanna will blow your mind with information. She's fantastic and we can't thank her and Daryl enough for giving us the best start to our journey!!!!!! Thank you both :o)"
72576,62519053,2016-02-15,457344,Sarah,98,"My stay with Ramona was outstanding. I had all the privacy and autonomy that I needed being on the third floor of her beautiful house. When it was hot, I could open the sliding door to the small balcony and when it was too hot, AC was available to keep me cool. Lovely decor, furnishings and sheets and super clean everything. Would love to stay again. And it was wonderfully easy saying hi and bye to Ramona. "
76867,110862498,2016-10-29,78100378,Sarah,97,"Once again so grateful to stay at Judy's home away from home.  If your looking for a great place to stay that is the perfect location to everything!  This is it. Judy is an amazing host makes you feel at home.  Perfect location, terrific host, private bathroom, really comfortable bed.  I have now been spoiled wouldn't want to stay anywhere else in Melbourne now."
150729,3041641,2012-12-08,3657142,Sarah,100,"Our stay at Ramona's was a highlight of our travels in Australia. It is a beautiful modern house and from the first day Ramona encouraged us to feel at home. There is lots of light, numerous terraces and Ramona has a great sense of style in the way she's decorated the house with all manner of interesting collectables and antiques. The room itself was lovely, with flowers and lovely little welcome gift!
The breakfast is standout, with delicious breads and muffins and a selection of yummy teas laid out for use during the day. 
Recommendations for local coffee and pubs were spot on - take her advice! - Fitzroy is a such a cool area and we could have spent our whole time in Melbourne just there! We did wander further afield though and found it very easy - tram stops are nearby or you can walk to the CBD. Also the Starbus shuttle Ramona recommended was great as it dropped us from the airport right at the top of the street.
Ramona was easy to get in touch with and communicated well.
Melbourne really did capture our hearts and when we return we will definitely book into Ramona's!"
70328,241224,2011-04-26,488050,Sarah,98,"Raewyn is such an inspiration and a true lady. I had such a wonderful time and she made me feel at home right away. She knows the area and the city really well, so she helped me out with all my questions and she even drove me around town. 
The beach house is so beautiful and just couple of minutes away from the shopping center, train station and the beach. So getting to the city was no problem. I really enjoyed my stay and highly recommend Raewyn and her awesome beach house. "
150729,15011286,2014-06-30,9238149,Sarah,92,Ramona was very welcoming and had plenty of tips and suggestions for me.  Love the d√©cor in her home - love all the upcycled pieces. Bed was very comfy and my room was great - the maps and other bits of information about the local shops and cafes were very useful.  And Fitzroy is great!  Excellent location.  All in all a great weekend.  Thanks Ramona!
297350,54925177,2015-11-25,48833201,Sarah,0,"Ryan and Rhiannon were friendly and made us feel really welcome in their home. On our first night we arrived in after 8pm and they offered us some spag bol that was gratefully accepted and delicious! The house was gorgeous and beautifully decorated complete with a bar, BBQ and hot spa. The room was clean, spacious and the bed was comfortable. And their brown Labrador Romeo is just a joy to be around. The house was situated a minutes walk away from a bus stop which takes you to the train which regularly makes trips to the city. This was my first air bnb and it was a great experience. I would be happy to stay here again. Thank you Ryan and Rhiannon. "
307615,874015,2012-01-20,1620043,Sarah,100,"Sharyn is the most friendly, accommodating host I've ever met.  I've stayed with her a few times now and have always been totally happy with the experience.  We first met on (Hidden by Airbnb) and I am very pleased she has moved over to Air BNB as this site is much better.  

The house is just perfect - it's really big and comfortable, with heaps of space to kick back (if you find time).   i quite like to relax on the terrace after a hard day shopping.  The bedrooms are a good size and have everything you need and then some.  It's great having a whole bathroom to yourself and very unusual for for this type of arrangement.  Sharyn is thoughtful enough to provide all sorts of bathroom goodies in case you forget to bring anything.  

Sharyn always makes sure there's drinks and food just in case you need something, but I usually eat out.  She's also got a great supply of picnic gear, umbrellas, spare coats and even leant me an evening bag last time I was there which was a total lifesaver.

I would recommend this property to anyone and will stay here next time I come to Melbourne.."
133617,1616990,2012-07-02,2744308,Sarah,90,"Spent long weekend in Melbourne. Great location. Easy access to transport and within walking distance to shops and pubs, restaurants. Hannah is extremely welcoming. Large size accommodation"
47100,434419,2011-08-10,773967,Sarah,90,"Staying at Loren and Ruth's was such a treat! The flat and the ladies were both so lovely, stylish and welcoming!! I would stay here again in a second! The fact that it is second walk from Bridge Rd make this the absolute perfect place to spend a few days in Melbourne! Couldn't recommend highly enough!!!"
365832,26661624,2015-02-16,21110376,Sarah,0,Susan was a terrific host. Her apartment is beautiful & I felt very welcome. No more than a 10 min taxi ride to the CBD & beach. I was made very comfortable & would definitely stay again. 
74548,5182076,2013-06-17,414849,Sarah,100,"Thanks for being a great host Mario! I had a great time. The room is located centrally and was close to everything I needed. Trams were easy to figure out, and any questions I had were answered by Mario easily. He directed me towards the markets, Federation Square and anywhere else I wanted to go. His place had everything you'd need. I only got into the pool twice, but it was wonderful. I spent only 4 nights here, but it went so fast, I will have to come back! Thanks!"
244952,37582367,2015-07-08,33709718,Sarah,80,Thanks Rebecca! We loved your place! Was cute and clean and in a great location.. We especially loved the proximity to all the amazing vegetarian restaurants along Brunswick street. Rebecca replied to all my emails within a day and I would definitely recommend anyone going to Melbourne to stay in her apartment. Thank you again. 
230790,34967734,2015-06-14,17264747,Sarah,91,The communication in the preparation for our trip was clear and punctual. Lee was there to meet us upon arrival and was very welcoming and friendly. The listing description of 'Clarelee' was accurate and was great to be able to accommodate my extended family in the one home without feeling like we were on top of one another. The neighbourhood was lovely and peaceful. It was great to be surrounded by so many trees and lovely fresh air. 
51592,71508714,2016-04-25,36998200,Sarah,100,"This apartment is AMAZING to say the least! The apartment itself is a nice open space, with large arch windows which are delightful to sit under and have a coffee as the morning sun filters through. There is a huge spa which is great to relax and take a soak in after a long day on your feet exploring. There's also a rooftop that you can overlook the city and of course a cute swing inside! Aside from the apartment itself the location is unreal you couldn't be closer to all the little laneways with great food, china town is just down the road for some of the greatest pork buns and dumplings and Flinders street is within walking distance. There is a tram just down the end of the main road from the apartment but we never needed to use it we were able to walk all over town from the apartment. Etihad station is within walking distance (approx 15 mins) if you want to catch an AFL game. There is also a really cool nitrogen gelato bar literally just around the corner from the apartment and also a really great Spanish tapas just around the corner in the next alley ways. Could not recommend the apartment more. If I was every back in Melbourne I would love to stay again. "
150729,258892765,2018-04-30,15952008,Sarah,91,"This is one of the best airbnb's I have ever stayed in! The room is lovely and the house is spotless & so stylish. Ramona is a fantastic host and wonderfully welcoming. She really does go above and beyond for her guests. Her tips on the area are so helpful, she also provides maps and lots of information leaflets. And breakfast.... the fact Ramona provides  breakfast at all is a real bonus in an airbnb but I was particularly excited as she provided the most delicious gluten free bread I have ever tasted. The area is also fantastic & you are surrounded by amazing bars, restaurants & shops. However the house is down a side street so it was also quite quiet away from the bustle of Gertrude Street - the best of both worlds. I would not hesitate to stay at Ramona's again. Thank you for a wonderful stay! I only wish I could have stayed longer."
163077,258240123,2018-04-28,56757348,Sarah,96,We had a lovely stay .. the hosts have thought of all the little things that make a big difference to the level of comfort in a home. They were very helpful and communication was excellent. We highly recommend this as a wonderful place to stay to explore Melbourne and surrounds.

161033,4348249,2013-04-29,2482128,Sarah,100,"We never wanted to leave this beautiful little cabin in Chum Creek. Every morning we'd get up and go looking for kangaroos in the property's 'garden'; we were never disappointed and felt like we were living in Jurassic Park. Karen was the best host: she left quince tarts for us in the cabin, along with a delicious loaf of local bread and other breakfast bits like milk and home-made marmalade. We slept so well in the cabin bed, and were even allowed to pick grapefruits and lemons (the best we've ever tasted; my boyfriend is obsessed with their flavour) from the gorgeous gardens. Karen also gave us loads of helpful recommendations for what to do in this beautiful area. I want to come back here as soon as possible, and I know my boyfriend feels the same way. We really loved our stay here. Thanks so much, Karen. "

We had our privacy and Daryl and Dee was there whenever we had a question.  We did not need anything as everything was there!  Loved the stay and will certainly recommend and even use again when in the area.  THANKS from all of us. "
241263,71545235,2016-04-26,29198079,Sari,89,"We arrived late and left early, but enjoyed our overnight stay and the spectacular morning views from the apartment.

Gloria is very hospitable and made every effort to accommodate us, to offer us refreshments and ensured our stay was comfortable. Thanks Gloria!"
75109,3467774,2013-02-03,3558297,Sascha,100,"Karen and her family are wonderful hosts and provide you with what I perceive to be an authentic Australian home stay experience. They will gladly give you any information you need and thanks to them, I could also optimally prepare my journey after leaving Melbourne. Speaking of the city, it's only a short train ride away with corresponding connections readily available; but don't forget to make full use of your location and head towards the nice little village of Williamstown on the other side and also visit the local park just around the corner. I thoroughly enjoyed my stay at Newport and would definitely choose the Williams family again when in Melbourne."
150729,270332595,2018-05-28,15586853,Sasha,92,Great experience. Liked the vintage touches. Location of Fitzroy is the Bushwick of Melbourne.

A nice touch was her ensuring I had my bearings by driving me around the area to show me what was in close vicinity to the house ‚Äì supermarkets, shops, restaurants etc ‚Äì these are all within walking distance."
150729,4004766,2013-04-02,5312129,Sasha,94,"Our stay in Fitzroy for Easter weekend was fantastic and a lot of that is down to unearthing Ramona's gem of a house in such a great neighbourhood. Ramona's hospitality was brilliant too - those bakery muffins were to die for - and it was a great introduction to AirBnB for us both. Stay here if you visit Melbourne, folks. Sasha and Andrew

363278,325843102,2018-09-21,40289716,Savira,85,"It will not be overrated to say that Alan is one of the greatest host i experience so far. He drove me to see the wild kangaroo and got me tasted some wine directly from the vineyard! Bed and pillow are super comfortable. Location is amazing! Surrounded by a lot of good cafes and restaurant, just 7 minutes walking from the Fitzroy garden. You can actually walk from Alan's place to the CBD area, but if you are lazy, just take Uber pool, it'll only cost you 4bucks! I LOVE MY STAY."

Picked us up from the airport and dropped us back at the airport when we left. Made it so much easier. The accommodation is incredible. House is absolutely beautiful and it's very easy to get to a train station to get into the city. Room was very nice and very decently sized for three of us. Very comfy nights sleep. Would definitely stay there again.

The apartment itself is immaculate, playfully cool and extremely comfortable, and there's more than a little magic in the experience of being a guest there.

I was only sorry that my stay revolved around a conference at the University of Melbourne and that I wasn't able to benefit as much from his hospitality as I'd have liked. 

His apartment is exceptionally well located for those visiting the CBD and very close to Parkville and North Melbourne. The view is fantastic and the apartment is a very comfortable space. 

I'd stay with him again on a return to Melbourne in a heartbeat and heartily encourage anyone else to do the same.  "

Lots of great cafes and pubs nearby that definitely kept us busy and entertained during the Australian Open week. Ramona offers great advices on where to eat and what to see. You can't ask for a better host.

The bedroom itself is super clean and stylish. I also used the study area quite a bit when I need to get some work done. Overall this has been one of my best Airbnb experiences. "

The apartment was tidy, the bed was huge and a desk was available. Even if you do not go to the city you can enjoy sunny days under the lemon tree in the garden.
The place is very quiet, but as well a bit far off. Luckily a bus (until 9pm) is very close to the flat and connects you to the next train (until 1am). You can even walk to the train station in 20 minutes. I would recommend this place without any hesitations.

Fay has been very generous, kind, and heart warming. Fay even took the trouble to really show me the area (leafy Armadale and its surrounds) and I also learned a thing or two about Eco-friendly household living. And I particularly enjoyed her lemon tree in the backyard the most.

I would recommend Fay's place to anyone who comes to Melbourne and wants to experience the real suburban living (as most Melbournians do).

My boyfriend and I also really enjoyed the organic and delicious breakfast, with fresh organic bread from the bakery where Ramona works. Thank you so much Ramona, we had a blast!

It's a comfortable and private apartment with lots of character in an old Melbourne building that has been completely renovated. The tram to the city is two steps away and North Melbourne is a great spot. 

Our host was very welcoming and helpful with information about the neighbourhood shops and car parking. He communicated well and thoroughly so I felt well informed throughout my whole stay.

There are two rooms- a bed room and sitting room with desk,  sofe and small table & chairs set. Because of the space, good size renovated bathroom and kitchen area it feels more like staying in an up market hotel with the feel of home.

It was pretty cold in Melbourne when we visited yet the heating in the apartment was excellent."

A 2 storey Victorian with all the period details, this is the perfect  place to stay. 2 blocks from 2 supermarkets and  the Carlisle St shops. The Balaclava Station is 2 further blocks away  on Carlisle--handy for taking SkyBus from the airport and the train from Southern Cross (City Loop to Flinders St;Sandringham line 5 stops to Balaclava). Chapel Street  tram for trendy Toorak Road is 2 blocks away.  ST. Kilda tram for the city museums and sites is 5 blocks away. 
I stayed in a light, airy upstairs room with an adjacent private bath. No AC,  but fan available. Elegant brekkie is available for less than a flat white and a roll out in town.

244952,39173321,2015-07-21,34488416,Shana,99,"The Treehouse apartment was perfect! Rebecca was a great host, leaving out detailed instructions for the apartment and some general information on the suburb and surrounds. I had a few questions for Rebecca regarding check in/out and although she was overseas, she was still quick to respond and gave us the contact details for her cleaner in case of emergency. 

The apartment was in such a perfect location. Inside the apartment was nice and cozy and quiet, however after exiting the apartment and walking a couple of minutes you could be in central Fitzroy on Brunswick st, or at one of the amazing little cafes of one of the other surrounding streets. 

The tram direct to the city was just a small walk away, and Rebecca leaves some public transport cards that you can use (and top up before you leave) for your trip. The apartment is also walking distance into the city, so if it is a nice day i'd recommend skipping the tram and going into the city by foot.

When we arrived the place was spotless, the cleaner that Rebecca uses does a great job. It was such a nice touch that the pantry and bathroom cupboard had a few things stocked in them. The place feels like home. 

The apartment is probably best suited for two people, however because we didn't spend much time in the apartment (and why would you with all that the city has to offer?) it was a great place for the three of us to stay for four nights. "
307630,914789,2012-02-11,1723409,Shane,88,"A really amazing warehouse style place in a perfect location. Sharyn's house is located right in the middle of Melbourne's CBD. All the great bars, restaurants, shops, art galleries, coffee houses, etc are less than five minutes walk away.  The train is only a block away and trams go right past the end of the street - totally convenient.
The house is two storeys and really huge and the bedroom was large and comfortable with lots of nice touches (that remark is from my girlfriend).  We had a bathroom to ourselves which was great and Sharyn thoughtfully provides lots of bathroom spares like shampoo and hand cream and stuff.  There was also breakfast supplies for us (except Sharyn took us out to her favourite place) and lots of other 'emergency' food for guests in what sharyn calls her nuclear apocolypse cupboard.
It's hard to believe something like this exists in the middle of the city, there's even a small garden which was great to relax after the flight - thanks for the beers btw Sharyn!  Sharyn was so accoomodating and helpful with our last minute emergency booking, nothing was too much trouble - she even made sure we got a reliable 'platinum' taxi service to and from our function which was a great relief after midnight in south melbourne.  The place is really comfortable and is just like it looks in the photos.  I hope to visit Melbourne again soon, and I can't imagine a better place to stay, or a better host.

Particularly in sending their Manager, Michael, to meet me on arrival and help me with my bags up the one flight of stairs, as I explained to them that I was 79 years of age and couldn‚Äôt manage the suitcases myself.
 
Michael helped in many small ways, setting me up with the portable air conditioning system and showing me where things were. Cleaning products and other small provisions were provided, ample for 1 person. Everything worked well and the internet was reliable for the whole 8 days.    
 
The air conditioning coped well during the first 3 days when the temperature was in the high 30s, and, although a little noisy, I was thankful to have it cool so well.
 
I have no hesitation in recommending Unit 7/93 Ormond Road to anyone wanting to stay in the popular Elwood Road area close to plenty of restaurants, Foodworks, coffee shops, and a greengrocer.

The heating in house was not the best. Upstairs in the bedrooms, the heating was good, but we couldn't get the heat to work well down stairs even with space heater. Also, there's a bit of a fire hazard. You can only lock the door from inside with a key. If you misplace the key while inside, you won't be able to get outside. Overall, good location in St Kilda but a bit of pain with car to cross main road. Great communication and clean. Would be great for a short stay, but would like a place a bit more comfortable for the week we stayed there."

Kate is a wonderful host and provided us with a cozy clean bedroom, our own bathroom and helped us get to know the area. Great amenities - outdoor area, lounge room/tv and kitchen. We loved the colourful decorations, a very happy house. The home is at a convenient location being walking distance to food, shops and the train station.

We were very lucky with the weather and though the cabin is fairly basic, we found that for our short stay we had everything we needed including a small fridge, kettle and toaster. We were pretty much left to our own devices after check-in and for our two day stay that was perfect as it meant that we felt as though we had our own private retreat. Location really requires a car to get around, but we think that's pretty normal in the area. "

John was welcoming, helpful and kind enough to let us use his groceries and utensils even-though we didn't have time to cook. Wifi connection was superb, it helped us to browse and prepare for activities of the next day. My husband enjoyed chatting with John and it's very unfortunate that we didn't have enough time to chit chatting & exchange ideas since we came back quite late every night. The neighborhood at Mount Waverley is quiet and clean with beautiful flowers at the lawn. It was a memorable stay....Thank you John, till we meet again in future! "

Judy has been both an Airbnb Host & Guest, so understands both sides of the Airbnb community. There are loads of brochures on how to get around Melbourne and things to see and do. Great if you're new to Melbourne or have been away for a while. 

The apartment has everything you need and is an easy 20 minute walk into the CBD. Great views of the bay. The indoor lap pool is an added bonus. There is also an IGA supermarket closeby.

Surprisingly quiet at night - great sleep quality. Good size apartment with clear instructions on where to find everything in the apartment and the area. Free wifi. Comfortable bed.
Cons: No clocks in the apartment (except on the stove, and it was wrong). No hygienic hand soap in the bathroom (only used cakes of soap). No DVDs to watch - need to pack your own. Sofa not comfy. Mould in the bathroom was awful - all over tiles and ceiling (I cleaned it myself or risked respiratory problems)."

The house is conveniently located for the airport and Brunswick area, but not too sure about public transport as we were using a car ourselves.  The bedroom was great and has its own en-suite so you can have as much privacy as you'd like, the fresh towels and use of washing facilities was also much appreciated.

The only thing I would point out is that there is no air conditioning in the bedroom itself, only in the house outside the bedroom.  I'm sure Angel would be happy to ensure the air conditioning is running and with the door open would cool the room, but might be more of a concern over night."

The location was brilliant the house, a secret gem and the hosts beautiful. 

The Location is in a secret quite street near smith street, tucked away and yet in the midst of it all. The house is a magical, 3 storey space, that goes all the way to the top of trees, reminiscent of a tree house. 
The kitchen large and comfortable, the balcony sunny and wooden, the top of the house a bed-room amongst the tree tops, with a bath, where I spent every evening reading a book amongst the 360 view of Fitzroy. 

The Hosts left me milk and champaign and fruits when I arrived, a bike when I asked for it and were just all round welcoming while I was there. They went out of their way to check up on me and see if there was anything that they could help with. After scouting for many places, I think this is the one I will keep coming back to time and again. Beautiful little piece of the Melbourne lifestyle. 

A little gateway to another world. A world within a world within a world. Thanks guys for a great time! "

Gloria is kind and it was nice talking to her. She likes to travel and she knows about many other countries. Also she was very kind and helped me post me sth that I left at her place by accident, and made sure I get it before I left Australia.

Malcolm's place is very conveniently located in the Melbourne free tram zone. There are lots of nice restaurants and cafes around and you definitely will not go hungry. 

The place is neat and tidy, fully equipped with the necessary items that makes the place a comfortable stay for at least two weeks."

The accommodation was great and had a good heater which helped in the Melbourne winter :) It was clean, well equipped and of a good size for one person. I was attending a course in Melbourne and it was ideal for getting some quiet study done in the evenings and to relax.

Both Allan and Lizzie were very friendly and made me feel welcome, relaxed and comfortable. Definitely recommend staying here. "

Rob offered us nice dinner when we arrived late n entertained my son with his guitar and good singing to make him relaxes in this new environment. We felt home n definitely recommend to any Melbourne new comers, it's very close to the airport and for cold days, electric blanket definitely helps a lot. They got nice garden too which you can see it from your room. "
297350,26103980,2015-02-03,25377476,Shuang,99,This is a wonderful place for the family to stay. Each art work is the record of the house owner's experience.  The house itself is more like diary of the host. Ryan is the handsome and his wife is abosultely pretty sweet heart. They give the useful tips to experience the best of the melbourne. I will highly recommend this full of fasion and happiness stay to others.

Not to be missed. 
47100,83922890,2016-07-04,13469531,Shyan,94,"Loren's place was always a nice, comfortable place to head back to after each day. Near the city and surrounded by cafes and restaurants, there was always something to do. 

My better half and I rented a car and Loren very nicely helped to get us a pass for parking in the area, even though she didn't have to.

Will definitely head back to ""Loren's"" when we're back in Melbourne again!"

Clarelee was slow to respond during our check in when we tried to inform her that she did not give us the correct keys to the home. But she did drop by later that day to give us the correct keys while we were out for dinner. Apartment is very big, but our allocated rooms were in the basement which was difficult for the elderly."

She provided a stunning home, miki cards, a loaded fruitbowl and even a bicycle to ride around town. I was here for around 10 days and was greeted warmly by Lulu, who continued to check in throughout my stay. I was sad to miss seeing her more, as she seemed like the loveliest most thoughtful person. Thank you for providing me with a home away from home Lulu! "
80986,25128141,2015-01-07,18165277,Sian,0,The place is in a good spot! It was too small for three people and didn't think it was good value for money. But the hosts were very helpful and let us check in early which was a massive life saver as it was 41degrees .

78143,228264300,2018-01-19,166524162,Sienna,100,"Upon our arrival, my two friends and I felt how little the host wanted us there. We took the high road, remained pleasant during every exchange, and just stuck it out until our three night stay was over. The bottom line was that the location and property itself were nice, but not worth feeling like intruders.

Some specific examples that come to mind:
-We were told not to tell the neighbors that we were staying there through an airbnb. ""Be vague."" Awkward.
-Scoffing comments about waking up at 10 the first morning after our road trip
 -Asserting that we aren't enthusiastic or motivated by being in a new city
-Refusing tea when I asked for it, which according to the listing, was supposed to be provided, replying with ""I wouldn't want to hold you up.""
-After I said waiting a couple minutes was no problem, Julie insisted on green tea, and I was awkwardly refused the black tea.
-Telling me there was no ice, which was awkward and untrue.
-There was never breakfast as the listing suggested, and we felt too uncomfortable to ask.
-Julie knocked on the bathroom door when we were using it. ""Is someone using the shower?"" ""Yes.."" *no response*
-She removed our perishables from the refrigerator the morning we were packing our car to check out. They sat out on the table for an unknown extended period of time.

We felt that the only thing welcome there was the money we paid to be there, but we as guests were an intrusion on her space."

His apartment is conveniently located to nearby amenities and that really is very important to a single traveller like me. He's concerned that I have a comfortable stay during the cold winter and I really appreciate that. Despite the cold weather, I really enjoyed the view from his balcony. Mario well deserves the title of a Superhost. I would like to be hosted by him again when I visit Melbourne next time."

Ramona was very kind and helpful, and we could easily get in touch with her on the phone if we had any questions. She has a lovely place, and we enjoyed sitting in her kitchen or outside on the lovely balcony. Fitzroy is a very nice place with many shops and caf√®s, and if you want to go to the city of Melbourne you can go by tram. 
We highly recommend a stay at Ramonas place, we enjoyed it very much!"

167067,10155331,2014-02-03,8331134,Silvia,96,"I stayed with John for my first two weeks in Australia. I have always believed that people you encounter first as you enter a new country end up strongly influencing the way you think about the country. First impression you may call it. It has always worked like that with me anywhere I have previously lived. So having John as a first contact with Australia was the best choice! He is incredibly sweet, helpful and thoughtful. Staying at his house was like staying with a family friend. He looks to talk as much as I do and we ended up having a lot of amazing talks. I learnt a lot from him and already planning on visiting him. The place is nice and clean, very close to the station. I enjoyed being away from the city and seeing a real life of people of Melbourne.

The house and room are very nice, close to public transport, shops and restaurants. We didn't miss anything during our stay. The queen size bed in the room is very comfortable. John is very easy going and most enjoyable company. He is eager to help with anything, we had nice talks and received valuable information from him.

51592,197560614,2017-09-26,14704548,Simon,87,"From memory all of the previous reviews have pretty much got it all right.

There are some wrong places to stay in Melbourne, but there are also several 'right' ones and this is definitely one of the 'right' ones. Its very central, uber Melbourne laneway grunge, with Collins Street around the corner and China town back up the street.

The place is fabulous and if you are looking at this apartment seriously it is because a certain style attracts you .... and you won't be disappointed, in fact you will probably find that it exceeds what you expect. The facilities and amenities are terrific and if you need something, it's there somewhere. Whilst it's is indulgently large, it would be a very cool place to work out of on business.  Very central to all relevant parts of the city and great home work spaces.

Michelle is terrific, and as she publishes comprehensive (and cool) guides to both restaurants and bars, more useful than you might imagine.

I'm coming back, and I'm not easily pleased."

72576,59353943,2016-01-10,3740030,Simon,90,"I very much enjoyed my stay at Ramona's house. The room/upstairs area was clean, comfortable and spacious, and very quiet considering its central location. The communal area downstairs is a very nice space too and I appreciated the breads and juices for breakfast.

Ramona is friendly and welcoming and gave some very useful tips for the local area. Fitzroy has so many bars, shops and restaurants that you could spend weeks exploring it, but it is also very close to the CBD and easily accessible to other areas via public transport. For all this it is excellent value. I would definitely stay here again and recommend strongly to other airbnb users."
281890,28754837,2015-03-29,14457242,Simon,94,Lovely house in a great location (I was at a board meeting in Spotswood but its a short walk to the train if you're heading anywhere else) and a great host.
150729,68467569,2016-04-05,2061332,Simon,0,"Ramona is the perfect Airbnb host, well organized, friendly, responsive (and I'm not even mentioning her excellent taste in music!). I really appreciated the time she took to have a chat or introduce me to the other people who were staying in the house at that time. All these little things (not to forget the tasty hot cross buns for easter)  make a difference and I'd love to come back. 
The place itself has probably been reviewed thoroughly before, but if it helps it can confirm it is very comfortable, has a good bed, is clean throughout, a nice outdoor area and all those other things. You won't be disappointed.

150729,22364001,2014-11-04,14251584,Simon,94,"We had an easy stay with Ramona in her cosy home. The directions to the house were fairly accurate and it took us 2 mins to walk from the main Gertrude street where the tram station no 14 was to her doorstep on Little George St. 

We stayed in the 1st room on the left as you enter from the main door. On this same floor, there is a toilet and 1 bathroom with a bathtub and shower. There is also a washing machine and a dryer, 1 little room and of course the master bedroom towards the end.

The living, dining and kitchen room was on the 1st floor, there were alot of breads and spread for breakfast, which made our stay complete since breakfast is the most important meal of the day. Some choice of teas and organic fruit juice, but we could not find any coffee.

Although there were guests from other countries all staying under 1 roof at the same time, Ramona always made a point to keep everyone informed of everyone's whereabouts which was good.

We were fortunate to bump into her on our 2nd night there, and she was very friendly and a lovely person.

We enjoyed our stay annd we would recommend this place to anyone looking to find a place not too far from the city."

247006,1898309,2012-08-06,459245,Sinan,91,"I stayed at Chris' place with my wife and 3 year old boy. He helped us in many aspects to make our trip more enjoyable; Arranged a table in the crowded restaurant the night we arrived, gave us an overview tour of the city, showed us the hidden cafes, gave us some tips on where to go in the city with a child and many more local ideas about Melbourne. His friendly attitude, talkative character and general knowledge on both Australian and world history made our stay more fun and informative. The surprise gift along with a bottle of champagne on my wife's birthday was a great gesture of him. It was great to earn a new friend.

His house in Albert Park is like 30 to max 35 minute walk to the CBD. Given the fact that my wife and I like jogging and me driving my son's stroller, I didn't feel it was far away. On the other hand there are 3 tram routes passing close by to his house and Chris had arranged his guests MYKI card beforehand (tram entry card) so we just had to top it up as much as we needed, we didn't need to pay an extra fee for buying the MYKI Card. The local restaurants and the bars in Albert Park downtown had very good atmosphere for my style of localization in a new city. The king size bed was comfortable and it was big enough for my wife, my son and me to sleep in. We stayed at Chris during winter. The kitchen and toilet was cooler, but the bedroom had an extra heater and the TV room had a huge heater which warmed the TV room and corridor pretty well. We had full access to the kitchen which was something important for us as home cooked food is a necessity once in a while when travelling long periods with a child. Chris bought us bakeries, different types of breads and cereals every morning and we could use the other essentials in the fridge freely as much as we wanted 

Travelling with a child, above all else the out most vital thing was trusting and feeling safe in the host I am staying and I give 100 % guarantee to Chris in this. Staying outside the city was convenient for us in Melbourne; it allowed us to see the places outside the CBD much more. I assume it is one of the best places to stay for Formula 1 race.  

Thanx for everything Chris, I really do hope to see you again one day. I wish you well in the all the cycling races. You have become our first friend who is into cycling this much."

The communal dining and lounge area is wonderfully sun drenched with a huge terrace which would be amazing for summer. The variety of healthy yummy organic teas, sweets and a generously stocked kitchen and fridge made it a warm and cosy welcome instantly. One would be challenged to stay in however, as the location of the house is in the heart of the most happening spot  in the dining, art, fashion and music scene in Melbourne right now, and only a 10 minute tram ride to the city. Her guidance on the good spots to go are great and affordable, trendy but never the fashion victim's choice, her thoughtfulness extends from hairdryer, hotties to a gorgeous umbrella collection  - much needed in melbourne!

Ryan and Rhiannon were lovely hosts, took the airport pickup which was great and had everything I needed there for the week. Location was great convenience for the seminar I was attending all week."
51592,214914105,2017-11-26,21031519,Siobhan,95,"Brilliant accommodation in so many ways. Just loved the space, large, character-filled, well-equipped and relaxing. The building and immediate locality clearly have historical significance and are a history-lovers dream. The location was idealistic... side lane off a 'little' street ie not off a 4-6 lane road, not particularly noisy considering it is in the middle of the CBD and close to 'Hardware Lane'. Also its an easy walk to Southern Cross and Flinders Street Stations, to trams, restaurants, cafes, shopping, attractions... 

As no place is perfect we will say, as Michelle has stated in her blurb, the windows don't have curtains, so it is light in the morning, I used an eye mask for sleep-ins. This also meant that on hot Melbourne 30+ degree days, with its north-facing location and full streaming sun, it was very hot in the loft in the daytime. During our week stay my partner was 'working from home' several of those days when it was distinctly uncomfortable. However was stunning and ideal at other times of day (watched a lightning storm from the roof-top), and tourists will generally be out touring during the day. In addition, Michelle was rapidly responsive when we texted her about a small issue during our stay.

Overall a very worthy 5 star experience. Only regret - wish I'd been flat hunting and found this place!! :-o"

It is pretty walkable to the city centre and there is a tram just down the main street that can take you there as well.

The room itself was warm through the two winter nights and the bed is extremely comfy. The yummy organic breads for brekkie are a great plus. Ramona was great with communication giving us detailed instructions on getting there and kindly sent me some nice recommendations for places to see and eat as I didn't have time to research in advance.

From the organic dairy free and gluten free muffins she left for us in the kitchen (I have allergies), to the fluffy robes on the back of the door and the welcome bar of raw chocolate on our bed when we arrived - we were in heaven. Ramona even leaves some topped up Myki tram cards for you to use and then you just pay her back whatever you spend which was SO helpful. She also has a great knowledge of all the cool bars and restaurants in the area and was always happy to give reccomendations. The house is amazingly decorated with vintage nicnacs and the third level upstairs is the perfect little hideaway. The location cannot be beat, a 5-10 minute walk from Brunswick street and the best that Gertrude street has to offer. Check out the cool art/design/gift store Third Drawer Down on Johnston street for cool one of a kind gifts and the breakfast at De Clieu cafe was sublime.

Equipped with everything you need for your stay, it is a great spot to enjoy the closeness of the Yarra Valley and perhaps if you were interested in spotting Kangaroos with joeys, you only need to step out of the door!

The house is beautiful and the vicinity is amazing. Its close to the city as well as the beach perfect location over all.

But the host lives with you so lack of privacy as she tends to enter your room if there is strong winds to close the window without knocking.

The pet is sweet and nice but he pee on the carpet if you are cleanliness freak then this could be a drawback.

The host had wifi issues as the host is too much of concern that you might use her internet a lot so she switch off the modem and sometimes take along her to movies"

Karen was impeccable in her communication from the outset; timely, precise and warm. She also offered some great insider tips, from the local gym to the very well regarded Tarrawarra Art Gallery, abd even invited me to join her and her husband at the local cinema! Other highlights worth your time include The Cherry Tree Cafe, sumptuous Healesvillr Hotel, Blueberry Farm, Yarra Valley Cheese Factor and of course the local wineries and Healesville Sanctuary. 

The continental breakfast was bountiful and the dwelling also offered a range of other complimentary supplies like orange juice, chocolate and fruit. The room itself is perfectly sized for an individual seeking a solo retreat as was my case, and equally catered for my boyfriend too when he joined me on the final night. Look out for the family of local kangaroos! They'll almost certainly pay you a visit. 

What you see is truly what you get in terms of this Air B&B profile! Thank you again Karen and co, I hope to stay again! "

A private room with a TV and own bathroom, we felt safe and comfy.

The location is great. We could catch a tram to town at her doorstop and we felt like locals. The nearby little shop provided us our snacks, and essentials. Very handy and convenient. And the nearby cafes, pubs and restaurants provided us the occasional dinner and drink. Our room and bathroom were spotless, the split system unit was effective both as a heater, and an air conditioner (it is Melbourne!), and the common area was amazing, with interesting and quirky d√©cor, access to cooking/toasting, and a comfy couch and a huge selection of DVDs if we wanted.

She was very helpful in introducing me to the city and was always up for a chat whenever I was around, always recommending me new places to visit, and sights to see. I really enjoyed how welcomed I was here. The place to close to three different trams (the closest being 5 minutes, the others up to 15 minutes), which provides a great connectivity to different parts of the city.

Only 20 mins in the train to flinders street station on a train located 5 minutes walk from the apartment the location couldn't be better. 

As someone not from the area I was incredibly impressed with Thornbury it's quirky and vibrant while being calm and laid back at the same time. 

My partner and I love a good breakfast and highly recommend brother Alec on the high street. 

Thanks for a great place to base ourselves while we explored a beautiful city. "

Vicki sure started it off on the right foot by picking me up from the Melbourne to Frankston bus, in order to take me back to her overwhelming house.  I really did appreciate it Vicki, and everything else that followed.  I was down from Japan for 8 nights, and I haven't slept so well in as long as I remember.  Beautiful, comfy Queen bed, and not a whisper to wake me.  Everything was spotless, the BGM great.....I could just go on raving.  This was my first Airbnb experience, but I know where I'll be heading next time I'm down to see my dear old mum. Thanks Vicki :0)"

51592,340717062,2018-10-24,218870096,Steven,99,"Michelle's place was even bigger and nicer than we expected!! We felt relaxed and excited the minute we stepped into it.  Honestly, the nicest AirBnB we've ever stayed in, and one of the nicest accommodations I've been to overall. The whole space is bursting with personality, and Michelle is the perfect, considerate host. We enjoyed having a large window-side bath, ambient music played through the (Hidden by Airbnb) Home, ample natural light, spacious kitchen, and really everything about it! Did I mention the swing? Who doesn't love a good swing to start your day? 

The apartment's location is just a few steps away from the free tram, and has easy access to Chinatown and Hardware Lane. We really got to explore a ton of central Melbourne without every worrying about transportation! Even with such a good downtown location, its placement in the alleyway made it feel a bit removed from all the bustle, which was lovely. For us, this was the perfect place to spread out and relax on our vacation. Michelle also offered plenty of recommendations and tips for places to check out, which was highly appreciated. 

The only thing I will mention is, due to its large windows and location smack-dab in the middle of the city, there's a decent amount of noise that comes in. So be aware if you're a particularly light sleeper. This can be from early-morning street-sweepers and deliveries or late-night revelers. The nearby clock tower begins chiming early on, as well. Also, the apartment has a single toilet which you have to go down the loft stairs from the bed and then up some small stairs to get to if you need to use it during the night. These things didn't really bother us personally, but for some it could be important to know! 

For us, at least, we never wanted to leave! 10/10 place that I would highly recommend"
363278,71935229,2016-04-30,8896260,Steven,94,"Really great place to stay in Melbourne and great host.

Jack is a great dog too!"

It's small but perfect and the location is the best. This is the coolest part of Melbourne by far. We love Melbourne and this area especially. Rebecca left maps for local walks and we used the 'Elegant Enclaves' one - it was great! You really don't need to go anywhere else but it's easy to get everywhere from here. The locals are very friendly too!

Also, Ramona‚Äôs bread is super yummy!

The photos are very accurate and the place is immaculate, every little corner has a special touch. We loved our stay, it really was living like a local. 
Our host was great at communication and very attentive and yet we were never intruded upon. Attention to detail was really evident and I have to say that the never ending muffins from the bakery really are as good as they sound! 
This was our first Airbnb experience and what a treat it was. We shall be taking our experience in Melbournes cultural heart with us on to our next destination.

The apartment‚Äôs location is ideal.  South Yarra train station is 3 mins around the corner and it‚Äôs only 2 train stops into the city.

Plus all that Chapel St and Toorak Rd have to offer.  
The bathroom & kitchen are well appointed and the bed is very comfy. 
I was surprised that in such a large apartment block, it was very quiet.  There is nearby building construction happening, but that will be short-term and it‚Äôs not too intrusive.  
A car park in the building is an added bonus!  
I have no hesitation in recommending the apartment."

Well we got everything we wanted but the unexpected bonus was the delightful time we shared with Sharyn and her sweet little dog Roger.  We made a friend, laughed a lot, talked heaps and promise to stay longer next time so we can spend more time with Sharyn!  I felt like I was lounging in my mate's house from the moment we got there.

317351,25925118,2015-01-30,23571982,Susie,100,"This was a great little flat for our first two weeks in Australia when we were relocating from the UK.  We had a very late check in on a Sunday night, but this wasn't a problem for the hosts.  On arrival there was a nice welcome pack for us, including coffee, tea, wine and TimTams!  Perfect.  Amenities inside the flat were great, such as a few small toys for our toddler, guide books/leaflets, CD and DVD player etc.  The hosts also offered us a highchair and/or travel cot before we arrived.  The flat was pretty clean, and is as spacious and bright as the pictures suggest.

The communication before and during our stay was excellent, Susanne was always very quick to respond and was very helpful.  

The location of the flat is good, a 7-11 a couple of minutes walk away and a playground a little further.  A tram stop just down the road to go further into St Kilda and a bus stop on the corner for heading into the City.  I was a little concerned that the flat might be a bit too noisy, as it is on a main road, but it wasn't a problem.  Our 4 month old slept well in the front bedroom, and the twin room where our toddler slept was at the back/side of the flat so a little further away from the road noise.  The road is pretty quiet at night.  

The flat is up two flights of stairs and there's no lift, but we left our buggy in the car so no problems there.  There was always plenty of free parking on the street right outside.  

All in all a great start to our year in Australia, this flat makes a good base for finding somewhere more permanent to live, and works well for people with kids.  "

Before I even arrived Ramona took care to email me extensive information on restaurants, cafes, bars and other places of interest in and around Fitzroy, along with questions of any dietary requirements I may have so she could cater for the right kind of bread. The room, ensuite bathroom and study nook are gorgeous, light, quiet and very clean. The house is beautifully and interestingly decorated, warm and welcome with ample light, and in a great location.

A stone's throw away from public transport, we didn't really need a car... everything is so close.  Restaurants, pubs, shopping, the choice was endless... but best of all, we took Julie's advice with the local attractions and we were not disappointed.  We will definitely be coming back.  Julie is a discreet host that offers her help if you ask for it.  She was very welcoming into her home and we just got along really well.  We had things to do and Julie had her own things to do... yes, Julie we will be back... it is the perfect place in walking distance to all the action if you want it...  or walk to a local hotel with great vibe and walk home again.  Perfect to relax at home or great if you want to go out too... and walk home.  Very secure and isolated, we felt like we were in our own little sanctuary.  Quiet and surrounded by residents who all live together in harmony and value each others privacy.   Perfect if you want to get away and just relax."

Thank you for everything !!! You are such a nice host, I will recommend my friend stay at your cozy house whenever there is a chance and I hope when I next visit Cherry in Melbourne, I can stay with you !!

Julie was a very helpful host, as were Billy and Flossie the two Maltese dogs (they're simply adorable!). Prahran is a great place to stay at with lots of shops and good restaurants nearby. The city is just about 2 train stops away and it's very easy to just hop on the tram and explore Melbourne. The only downside to the place is the lack of Wi-Fi, but there's so much to see and do in Melbourne that you won't be missing it much!"

It's in a quiet area but is still very conveniently located. Eleni immediately made me feel welcome in her home and was very helpful. She went out of her way to point out important places near the house such as the nearest shops and bus and tram stops when I arrived. She also does beautiful paintings that are hung up around the house. I very much enjoyed staying here and would recommend it to anyone. Eleni is very kind and easy going in general and a great host!

Our stay was with Madam Judi, who proved herself a kind and very hospitable host. She took care of our accomodation needs in very organized mannr. We were amazed by her friendly and warm welcome. He behaviour and dealing during the stay were excellent. Also the location of accomodation was very nice as its few meters away from Shrine or rememberence, Albert Park, MCG, Fed Square, Yarra river and many more toursit attractions. It will be our best attempt to stay at same place during our next visit to Melbourne."
111001,210500940,2017-11-09,2347377,Tahira (TJ),95,This experience is a two in one! You wander around unknown places in Harajuku and you can have lovely photos of yourself! Yulia is so lovely and it's fun to go to parts of the city that you normally would never see. For me that's what travelling is all about. Go off the beaten path and explore what's not seen (or barely seen) before. ^_^

Sharyn was a superb host. It was so helpful to have her nearby if we needed advice but she was never in your face. We arrived in Melbourne at 6am and couldn't have been more thankful to her for letting us check in early. 

We really enjoyed Sharyn's local knowledge, the location was fantastic and we hope to be back again. "
74959,355083271,2018-12-02,3732727,Tahnee,100,"Linda's place is absolutely beautiful. From the polished wooden floors to the high ceilings, it is spacious and stylish and artistic. She is an amazing host and the house has every single thing you could possibly need, both in the kitchen, the bedroom and the guest bathroom.

I cooked my own food there, and the kitchen was very large and beautiful, well laid out and it was easy to find everything I needed. And Linda gave me enough space in her fridge, freezer and cupboard to store all of my food.

The guest bedroom is small, but it has a cosy feeling. And the Queen sized bed is DIVINE, so plush and and comfortable. I wish I'd had time to sleep in every morning! 

The location was incredibly convenient for me as my parents live in Beacon Cove and I was here to visit them. But even if I wasn't, it's an amazing location, only a few metres from the bay where you can go on long walks by the water, and only minutes by foot from Bay St where there are tonnes of cafes and shops. The 109 Tram from Beacon Cove takes you straight into the city. So central! I will definitely stay here again, next time I come down to visit my parents. Thanks Linda!"

Feel like home during the stay. She really paid attention to details you will see if you stay at her place especially in a bathroom (she provides sun cream, after sun spray, wipes, and many things like you walk into you own bathroom.)

Most of all she was really nice and fun person. We had a great time in the evenings chatting and especially movie time!!!!
(special thanks Judy introduced me to new series!!)

I would love to stay with Judy again if I have a chance to visit Melbs"

Loved the top floor which was light & clean & gorgeous, and had a very comfy bed with crisp, white, hotel-style sheets. So many things to like - the organic raw choccies left as a gift, the selection of teas left out in the kitchen, muffins & breads, the vintage-cool decor..all of it! There was another couple when I was there & also a guy from Germany- I bumped into all of them & Ramona but only briefly. All were friendly. But it was more like I had the place to myself when I was there - admittedly not much. There was lots to do! Best accommodation ever!"

Neil met us and showed us around. The space is attached to the back of the main house, however my parents said it was very quiet and peaceful. It was lovely and clean, and the bed was very comfortable - which is something to be said from my father. 
The accommodation is very close to Errol st and a tram stop which goes directly into the city. Very useful for my parents to get around. Would highly recommend Neil and this accommodation, "

We never got to meet Simone and Guiseppe (as they were traveling as well) but they had one of their friends meet us at the apartment and we we're able to pay her $20 for 3 days use of the wi-fi internet at the building. It was a consistent enough connection, that we were all able to (Hidden by Airbnb) with family back in the States.  Thanks again, only wish we could've stayed longer.

The building itself is very modern, though, with full amenities (including laundry). Ramona is also the most thoughtful host I‚Äôve stayed with. She‚Äôs very communicative, making check-in a breeze, offering a ton of recommendations you should definitely take, and always friendly when we did see each other. The room is full of thoughtful touches, including ear plugs, maps, walking tour brochures, water, etc. I haven‚Äôt even mentioned how awesome the neighborhood is, but Fitzroy is very cool with a lot of chic bars, brunch spots, and restaurants as well as classic pubs.

The location was absolutely perfect for our needs and a perfect oasis from the bustling city, but with everything within walking distance.  We so enjoyed our daily walks along flinders street and in the surrounding areas.

Apartment was clean, light and airy and very practical for us.  Carpet was new or near new and it was very easy to relax.  We would deifnitely come back. "

It was only a shame I didn't get to spend more time with each of you, you were both so lovely and laid back.  The place was gorgeous, a stunning little unexpected piece of bliss to come home to at the end of the day, made that much easier by your accommodating hosts. The location is great and if you don't feel like  walking into the city, the tram is right there. The bed is comfy, the house clean, they provide loads of heating (it was quite cold when I was there) and Loren & Ru provide plenty of guidance to help you around. Had an awesome time and look forward to seeing you again, hopefully soon..."

A little hiccup in getting into the apartment as there were road works but Mia responded to my distress calls immediately. The apartment was well furnished and the bed was super comfortable. Will definitely stay here again and recommend it to others. 
74548,1195939,2012-04-29,1889788,Tharshan,98,"A good place in heart of the city for a short stay.

I found Mario's place to be very clean and well presented with a large televison in common living room. A clean ensuite single bedroom with all amneties and linen. 

Being in the city itself was a huge advantage with easy access to every thing within walking distance. Additionally it had easy access to trams, train station and busesses.

Mario was also a good host who simply loves his apartment and his belongings. Additionaly Mario was able to provide suggestions on what to do in Melbourne. The other nice part about Marios apartment complex is the fact that it has a well equipped gym and other related facilities. Surely as advertised a great place to stay for a Single person."

Yoga studio is great.
Can be a bit noisy from the road and the pub across the road. 
Bathroom was unclean as was the kitchen. Made me a little uncomfortable and I ended up choosing to eat out mostly. 
The host was nice though I didn't see him much. No one was there when I arrived and for the first week of my stay. 
House is super full of stuff and quite dark. An amazing assortment of oddities filling every available space.
Room was neat and had a desk and good internet. "

It is inspiring what a woman with taste and style can do with PVC pipe. Brilliant!

Communication and planning was seamless; the accomodations were clean, comfortable, and well appointed; the residence although extremely urban was quiet but for the birds at dawn (I used earplugs after that); the baked goods were excellent; her thoughtful tips were always spot on.

Ramona is close to Victoria Market and it had me thinking I should plan a longer stay where I cook a bit and really live in the city. 

I would return to Ramona's in a heartbeat."

The apartment is elegant, and the accommodation private, homely and very quiet. It was also enjoyable to meet a number of her friends; it's clear she is a key member of the local Port Melbourne community.

51592,474114524,2019-06-22,235465977,Timothy,98,Ive never enjoyed a stay so much before and been so satisfied in every way possible of the hospitality. The warehouse is in the center of everything you could possibly wanna do while in Melbourne and coming back to it after a day out or night out was perfect. Couldn‚Äôt have been happier with Michelle‚Äôs instant replies and all the tips she gave me on where to go and where to eat. Next time I come to Melbourne I hope this is still available because I wouldn‚Äôt stay anywhere else. Wish I could live there.
241263,30272430,2015-04-19,31273363,Timothy,90,Look no further and book to stay with Gloria. All the reviews are true.  Gloria is a superhost located in a super location. Enjoy your stay.
257915,46717777,2015-09-13,37740204,Timothy,0,Neat tidy apartment and close to amenities. Enjoyable stay and perfect for larger groups or families.
281890,223184668,2018-01-01,152461058,Timothy,100,"Really nice people, they‚Äôre such a nice family. It‚Äôs a really nice large room with everything you need. A place to sit and work, a big comfy bed, there‚Äôs even a mini fridge in the room. The train is a bit of a walk from the house, but it‚Äôs not too bad. It‚Äôs about 40 minutes to flinders street station. I would recommend to others, and I‚Äôd stay there again next time I‚Äôm in Melbourne."
47100,2650934,2012-10-18,3442168,Timothy,94,"Seriously charming house with 2 charming, easy going and sweet ladies. Always advising us where can we get good buys and so sweet to allow us to dry our clothes for 2 days due to weather... And sweetest that they kept our clothes for us as we are out late... Highly recommended!!!"
43429,102832107,2016-09-19,90883092,Timothy,100,"We needed an extra bedroom to host our parents and this place was perfect. It is a very quiet, private, self contained granny flat with everything you need. We'll definitely book again."
76867,2941490,2012-11-22,3992725,Timothy,99,"We only stayed about 2 days in Melbourne and Judy's place was a real gem: modern apartment with great views, walking distance to CBD, Boranic Gardens and St. Kilda and tram stops only block away each direction. There are a couple of great places to eat literally around the corner. 

The guest room was very comfortable, and we had our private bath with sets of soft towels and separate restroom.

Judy was the most hospitable host one can wish for and she made us feel at home right away. Moreover, it felt like staying with a friend rather then with a host. As I was sick the whole duration of our Australian trip and had a bad cough, I literally ""lived"" on Strepsils, Aussie cough lozenges. To my surprise after a bout of bad cough one morning I found a packet of them left for me by Judy. Thank you, Judy, they were my life savers that day. 

We also found a lovely surprise of strawberries and TimTams with the ""Eat me""! note the night we were back from a day trip to Phillip Island. Only a good caring friend would do that, don't you agree? 
We definitely recommend staying at Judy's place during your stay in Melbourne."

The apartment location was 10 out of 10 - only a couple minutes walk to the train station and there is a good selection of restaurants / cafes / groceries / shops nearby. Enjoyed having a balcony and secure car park. Also recommend eating at Two Birds One Stone cafe for brunch. Would stay again."
51592,60408394,2016-01-23,51697634,Tina,100,Michelle made us feel most welcome upon our arrival!  She showed us around the apartment as well as provided us with many options of things to see and do in Melbourne.
313648,1431364,2012-06-07,2037172,Tina,96,"The apartment was located in a quiet neighbourhood, and once we found our bearings, it was actually quite easy to get around to the city, Victoria Street and Smith Street.  The apartment was self-contained but the best thing were the heaters and Wifi!  Haydn and Katrina were patient in showing us directions to the places we  wanted to go and even recommended restaurants for a good steak.  We tried Prince Patrick Hotel and it was fabulous!  This was like a home away from home.  I wished we stayed an extra day."
313648,45487810,2015-09-03,19942961,Tina,99,"The house is a nice place to stay. You can find almost anything you need there which makes you feel like staying at home. The kitchen that is spacious and well-equipped is my favorite. The location is perfect. There are Many delicious restaurants and a supermarket nearby , and the distance to the CBD is just 2km which you can just walk there.
Haydn and Katrina are very kind and helpful. Thanks for providing such a lovely place for us to stay in Melbourne!"

The position is fantastic, just a leisurely stroll to so many wonderful coffee shops, restaurants bars and boutiques...a perfect combination. I loved staying there and will be going back very soon. Thanks for everything Mia...next time the 'San Pellegrino' are on me. Ciao a presto!"
244952,153846315,2017-05-22,22521889,Tj,0,"The Treehouse - a home away from home, situated between Nicholson and Brunswick St. In a perfect little pocket of Fitzroy, close to all the delicious food and cool bars Fitzroy has to offer. Not only that, but it's so close to the CBD you wouldn't even need a stamp to post a letter! The location is great the apartment, with its off-street car park, spacious bedroom and cute kitchenette, allowed for quite the little Haven. Would recommend to all traveling to Melbourne or for Melbournians wanting somewhere a little closer to the CBD for the weekend!"

The flat is clean and very nice. And it is quite close to the city centre, so Judy did not promise too much.
Thank you very much for the nice days in Melbourne!"
150729,59692587,2016-01-14,5040776,Tobias,0,"Ramona was a very accommodating and generous host, and made our stay in Fitzroy one to remember. Firstly, the room was as described and had cute litte touches such as a welcome gift, Melbourne travel brochures and glasses of water (to name a few things). Arrival was a very smooth affair and we had clear instructions as to how to enter the house and where to park as Ramona would not be at home at the time. Ramona wasn't often at home, but when we did bump into eachother she always made sure to recommend the best restaurants and bars for me and my partner as we didn't know the area so well, and her choices were always spot on! She also ensured we were comfortable at all times (and only a phone-call away), and never made us feel like we were asking too many questions.

I would definitely recommend this place if you wish to have the vibrant, artsy northern part of Melbourne at your doorstep, whilst still staying at a quiet house."
297350,33969873,2015-06-02,34527666,Tobias,99,"Ryan was a professional host, when we entered we were briefed in detail about the appliances and functions within the house which can be used there were even helpful guides in each room to explain with relevant and pictorial locations on a map of local cheap and good eateries, shopping locations and even travel guides of varying cost efficiency which to my friends and I found were extremely helpful as we were new to the area.

It was nice and cozy, we felt at home and even the dog was very friendly albeit energetic we found him cute and it didn't treat us as strangers in the slightest.

Lastly I would like to thank Ryan for his company, answering our silly questions immediately on how to operate certain things in the household , being there for us at witching hours in the night during the check in timing to allow a smooth transition into the home for the stay and during checkout it was hassle free.

So to all future travelers to Ryan's place hope you all have as much as a blast like my friends and I did and enjoy your trip!

229430,29840339,2015-04-13,5466486,Toby,96,"An amazing stay! Daniela was everything you could want in an AirBnB host. Warm and generous with her time. She was more than happy to offer advice on where to go and what to do and give a locals perspective on her city. The house is modern, clean, spacious and well heated. The location is excellent. The 70 and 75 trams stops right out front, perfect for getting to the city or to the stadiums. Also perfectly located for getting out to Deakin university or other south eastern locales. "
256186,55776634,2015-12-06,6482737,Toby,96,"Awesome place to stay! Coming home one evening I overheard a girl on the street tell her girlfriend, ""And this street is like... like... s (Phone number hidden by Airbnb) Collingwood"". I guess that sums it up :) 
Very comfortable apartment in an old warehouse block, perfectly decorated and equipped with everything we needed. Spent 3 weeks here with our 11 month and were happy about the high-chair and toys, plus the large open-plan space for her to play and learn to walk.
Hoang and Michael went out of their way to accommodate us."

72576,4272435,2013-04-23,5601989,Toby,97,"Ramona was an excellent host. Very helpful and welcoming and interested in making our stay as comfortable as possible. She also provided very tasty bread and muffins from the bakery where she works...mmm.

The location is quite good. Lots of cafes, bars and restaurants in Fitzroy itself, and there's a 5 minute walk to the tram stop with a 15 minute tram ride to the centre of Melbourne city.

We found the 3rd floor bedroom and ensuite to be quite private and averagely comfortable. The separate study counter was useful for working. A fully equipped, shared kitchen and shared living area downstairs means some loss of privacy, but if you're looking for some casual, light conversation, then that may be fine. To me, the somewhat quirky decor was not to my taste and seemed cluttered."

161033,11441583,2014-04-02,10903962,Todd,98,"A great place to sit and work in the peaceful surroundings without all the office distractions. A short walk will put in amazing surroundings and a short drive into town. Planning on making this a regular midweek visit.
Karen was great as was her husband. Very accommodating and flexible making the visit a great one. 
Affordably priced and definitely recommended."

Everything went so perfectly. In the lead up to our stay, Dan was alerted to some construction work that may disrupt our morning on Saturday and Sunday. Dan handled this so well and offered us some reimbursement for the noise disturbance. This was so above and beyond our expectation and really made us feel totally looked after and welcomed. Thank you again Dan for an amazing stay and we hope to be back sometime soon. Thank you Tom & Amelia"

A beautiful little self contained cabin, wonderfully catered and looked after - for those wanting to visit the Yarra Valley/Healseville area, I can't recommend it enough. Karen was very helpful and approachable. A personal highlight for me was seeing the mob of 10+ eastern grey Kangaroos each dawn and dusk a few steps from the door. Truly a wonderful thing to see!"
227028,21461935,2014-10-18,19663330,Tom,98,"I spent a couple of weeks in Melbourne for work and needed a central location that was going to be a comfortable place to bear down and get things done when I wasn't in our office in the CBD, with good, solid wi-fi that wouldn't cost me an arm and a leg (like most hotels in Australia) and easy access to caffeinated libations and excellent Asian food.  Dan's flat easily ticked all the boxes and more.  With several excellent coffee joints and an abundance of great food within a hop, skip and a jump away, I certainly took advantage.  As a runner, it was also wonderfully convenient - just a few kilometres down to Albert Park lake, or north up to Royal Park.

Dan also provided some great tips on places to go or eat, and to-the-tee instructions on how to work everything in the flat.  She was very welcoming, available when necessary, and overall, a great host.

If / When I'm back in Melbourne, I'll certainly be looking to see if the place is available again."

The room was a good size and the bed was very comfy, I found it hard to get up most mornings!

If your looking for a great way to meet new people, and like having a slightly more homely feel to your stay, I would definately recommend staying here. if i wasn't going back to england i would stay longer! And i would definately stay again in the future. 

Had a fantastic week!

The apartment itself was awesome. In terms of the accommodation itself, the location and the atmosphere it was brilliant. 
The apartment is spacious and insanely cool. There was a cool coffee shop a stone throw away and we were surrounded by great restaurants and shopping. However this apartment was tucked away enough that it was a fabulous haven after a busy day of eating, sightseeing and shopping.
Can't wait to head back to Melbourne soon and hope we are lucky enough to stay here again. Thanks heaps Michelle!"

We booked very late the night before our stay and received a very prompt reply even though it was going to be Gloria's birthday . When we arrived Gloria could not have been more welcoming and the photo's don't do the accommodation justice . Gloria also showed us around the area she must be Melbourne's friendliest host !

She made me feel like I was staying with a friend rather than at an AirBnB.  She goes out of her way to help you make the most of wonderful Melbourne and if you're in during the evenings you'll love chatting with her over a glass of wine. Her home is immaculate, amazing views, the bed is so comfy, wifi is good and the separate bathroom is the icing on the cake. The location is perfect too - walking distance into town, south Melbourne market and st kilda. I can't recommend staying here enough. Thanks Judy and please stay in touch!"

150729,10446451,2014-02-19,9532532,Tory,99,"Staying at Ramona's is a real pleasure. 

Ramona is an excellent host. She is considerate, eco-conscious, friendly and always happy to offer advice. The room and house reflect those values and is stylishly decorated. 

The room is nice and comfortable. It is well decorated and has a little bureau of local information should you need it. 

Next time I would like to try out the third floor room (in a separate listing) - we had terrible jetlag and would probably have liked a separate bathroom so that we didn't feel like we would wake anyone up in the night. 

The house is in a great location for experiencing the hippest shopping hub in the city, Gertrude Street and Brunswick Street so if you love good food and interesting fashion and homeware boutiques you're in luck. It's also well connected by tram so getting into town is also easy. "

257149,298863924,2018-07-29,56277751,Tracy,96,This two bedroom apartment was clean and comfortable and location was perfect while visiting our daughter. Quiet and safe neighborhood with easy walking distance to two tram lines and a train. However sleeping was difficult due to the amount of light in the front bedroom and would have been more pleasant if block out curtains were placed in this room. Lanie communicated timely and check in very easy. Would recommend this apt for those wishing to stay inThornbury.

I thoroughly enjoyed my time here, and I know you will too. They go out of their way to make sure your stay is enjoyable and that your needs are met.

Ryan and Rhi know Melbourne really well and have lots of ideas for  things you can do during your stay. In fact, Ryan and Rhi are in the process of creating a directory of sorts that lists all their favourite places in Melbourne, be it restaurants, clubs and pubs or site seeing adventures. And if you like beer - then Ryan is the man to talk too (and have a beer with) as it's one of his passions. I tell ya, they go above and beyond what you would expect from a host.

So if you're looking for a comfortable, safe and interesting place to stay, and you want to experience it with a vibrant, caring and genuinely nice couple, then Ryan and Rhiannon's home is place you want to be. Great value for a great time!"

The location is within easy walking distance to Parkdale railway station, restaurants & shops.  Its also a lovely walk to the Bay.  We will return to Barbaras place in the future."

The Studio itself is built lovingly, the furniture comfortable and cosy and the atmosphere extremely charming and pleasant!
 We felt from the very first moment entchanted with our hosts  and the studio. There is a also the magcial little backyard, we enjoyed very much. The place is near to all very famous streets in Fitzroy with it¬¥s lovely shops, cafes and enormous varieties of foodstores! If you are vegan or fan of healthy food, you find lots of delicios little shops and restaurants! Tram or Bus to the innerCity (not more than 10 minutes drive to federation square e.g.) or other places are nearby! Our hosts helped with every information we needed. And for people who loves art: This is the perfect place to be: Galleries, Art Supplies, Artists, Designers, Museums... And for people who love Yoga: There is a wide range of offers and beautyful places! And for people who loves fashion and design: You find the must beautyful shops of Melbourne Designers all in walking distance in Fitzroy!
After few days with my husbands i spent almost 7 weeks in the studio Lulu... I felt safe and was very lucky with my hosts, who cared and looked for any well-being of my stay! Thank you Lulu and Family!

The cabin provides privacy and tranquillity by being situated ~50 meters away from the house and looking out to the garden. Everything was clean and the bathroom appeared recently renovated. Karen and Michael are a wonderful couple that make you feel at home at their place. When we arrived Karen had collected oranges from the garden so we could start our next morning with a glass of fresh orange juice!"

227028,431416214,2019-03-31,1589763,Uno,0,"Dan's place was perfect for us - incredibly central located, you cannot get more in the middle of the city than this. We had a newborn baby with us (born while staying here), and it was a fantastic choice of ours be here then. We stayed long term for over a month.
The space is larger than expected inside, due to the high ceilings, which makes the smart use of space even better. 
You might ask if the place is noisy? Yes you are a) in the middle of a very busy street in the city and b) right next to the construction of the new subway station. Neither of these bothered us at all and in fact gave us a nice lull and didn't bother our newborn at all.
The bed was a bit tricky to get in and out of as it's low on a raised section of the floor. This was only an issue for us after having to get up and out of bed quite lot of times during the night because of our baby, but otherwise it would not be an issue.
Dan was responsive to all our queries and check-in and out was super easy.

Our recommendation: Stay here if it's available. You won't be sorry!"

This bright, sun lit home was perfectly located and set-up in the heart of Melbourne close to everything we needed and wanted: Duke's coffee downstairs, countless lively cafes and restaurants, and walking distance to the arts and cultural precinct. 

Travelling with young children is tricky and Dan's modern and warm apartment made us feel immediately at home in terms of aesthetic - fantastic taste in furniture and design - and plenty of books and toys for children under 5 which brought immense joy to our little girl. Dan was also very kind to leave a list of 'kid friendly' activities around the CBD.

If you don't mind the soundtrack of the city, Dan's apartment is perfect for discerning travellers who don't want to skimp on taste all round. "

Her two doggies are cute and very polite, would greet you at the door but won't disturb you otherwise. I slept in until noon two of the four days I stayed - no  city noises the morning , just chirping birds. In the morning, I enjoyed going to Prahran markets, which are nearby, caught the train to the city during the day and went out around Chapel street for drinks and dinner (go to Hanoi Hannah's for casual vietnamese, you wont regret it).  There are tons of cafes and bars within walking distance to Julie's house. Prahran is one of the best areas to be in Melbourne."

Organic orange juice and organic sourdough and vegan spreads. Ramona herself is a delight and incredibly helpful she even booked my taxi for my departure.

It was a tidy place with space to move in such a big city. We would love to stay there again when we visit Melbourne again.

310594,283960139,2018-07-01,2031006,Vikki,94,"Well located near Collingwood Station and a 10-minute walk to Smith Street. Architecturally interesting space with lots of room to spread out at the kitchen table, a good kitchen and BBQ - it was a good spot for our extended stay in Melbourne. This is a space good for an individual or a couple only - there is a loft bedroom and no doors to close if you are on different sleep schedules. We had some communication issues with Bridget around a noise issue coming from next door - the issue resolved itself after 48 hours but Bridget was unfortunately not actively helpful. There was only 1/3 of a toilet paper roll left for us on a 2+ week stay, host suggested we buy our own before conceding to drop off an appropriate supply for our length of stay. There were lots of the host's belongings (half-used essential oil bottles, a used razor, etc) left in the shower, in common areas, next to bed, as well as the place could have been better dusted. I would recommend staying here but in the future,  the host could do a little more to prepare the space for guests."

Chris was very generous with the breakfast spread, tea, coffee and the use of kitchen appliances. His tips on local walks and eating places was helpful to us. Also he has great knowledge of traveling. So I picked up some tips for my next Australia holiday which will be  driving on the great ocean roads. I will definitely visit Chris' place again."

We had booked only 1 room but since another one was empty, she was kind enough to let us use it as well ! She is always there if you need anything but is also considerate about her guests' privacy. Her son Andre is also really friendly and nice (he spontaneously offered to drive us to St Kilda on our second day there). We had great chats together and it felt like we were a little bit part of the family !
The house is pretty isolated but we enjoyed the quiet neighborhood, as well as the wild and beautiful garden ! On the day of our departure, Loretta drove us to our next airbnb location, which was really kind and generous of her.
Thanks again !"

Ramona was such a kind host, giving us all the help we need! Like what other guests said, the breads from her bakery were delish! :)

The house was within walking distance to the main attractions in Melbourne, and the walk was really pleasant. The surrounding neighbourhood - Smith St, gertrude st, brunswick, had so much to offer. 
After  our trip, we had a returned parcel from sydney and Ramona kindly help us re-send it at the post office.

I wouldnt hesitate to stay here again!"

We were able to walk pretty much everywhere we wanted, however if walking is not your thing public transport is really close. It's amazing how peaceful and quiet the apartment is, with a lovely outlook into the trees and glimpses of the Melbourne skyline beyond. We felt very much at home there in our 4 night stay.

Her place is clean, wonderfully decorated, and extremely well located. Not to mention that the scent of freshly baked goods constantly permeates the house! For travellers, this is one of the most ""Melbourne"" neighbourhoods you can stay in (trust me, I was born and raised here). Highly recommended! Thanks again Ramona."

He answered all my ""queries"", provided great ""tourist/sightseeing"" information, suggestions and tips. He explained more details regarding Airbnb (as i was a ""first time user""). Mario's apartment was clean and comfortable, very accessible + the location was excellent for getting (via foot) to so many points of interest/tourist destinations, the central CBD, walks along the river, the laneways, gardens, MCG, galleries, Rod Laver Arena, a great variety of restaurants, and bars,etc.

She made us feel totally at home in her lovely abode.  
Buff the Spoodle is a delight.
An extremely comfortable bed; Spacious own bathroom; ideal breakfast with tea and coffee making facilities plus the use of her expansive kitchen.
We sat  around and enjoyed the footy with Linda and her friend and she even treated me to a very nice cocktail.
We highly recommend this address for a stay in Melbourne.  The local area has a lot to offer and a tram into the city is a 5 min. walk away, all very convenient. It is quiet and scenic if one takes a 2 min. walk to the waterfront, with a great variety of cafes and restaurants close by."

I didn't get to see her very much, but I appreciated her attention to detail, open and caring manner and the delicious bakery goods. Great energy and vibe. The bed was really comfortable, which I desperately needed. Also really handy that she had many brochures and ideas of things to do.  My stay in Melbourne was made so much better because I stayed at Ramona's, which is in a wonderful and convenient location.

Our flight landed late at night and he was happy to see us and show us into the apartment when we finally arrived after 1AM. He was also very flexible with our check out time since our flight did not depart until after midnight and thus let us stay in the apartment until 10PM on the day of check out. The apartment is in a great location to all the attractions of the CBD and well situated if you want to go out to surrounding neighborhoods.  When the internet went out Malcolm worked very hard to try to repair and and was apologetic for the inconvenience. There were staples in the apartment, milk, butter, sugar, etc which was most helpful and even a welcoming bottle of wine!

After a friendly greeting we were left to our own privacy - which suited us just fine. It was great popping into Michaels awesome hat shop SMART ALEX and amusing encountering all manner of people wandering through and the charming way Michael attended to their needs.

 For the first time, I experienced the authentic Australian life in Barbara's home in Australia for two months. The beautiful garden makes our baby Thomas enjoy himself every day. Barbara likes Thomas too! In parkdale, Australia, I recommend Barbara's home. Trust me, this is a safe and quiet private living space for you to feel at home! It is 5-8 minutes' walk from the railway station, 3 minutes' drive, there are convenience stores with supermarkets and gas stations, and it is also very close to the seaside, it is 10 minutes' walk and 5 minutes' drive! We like this beautiful grandma and her home very much! We hope we can come back again! Enjoy the beautiful English gardens ! Thank you for taking care of us, Barbara! Thank you very much!"

I'd already lived in Melbourne before and was just visiting, but the location and place was perfect. Nice open space and great large table, had everything you needed. Bridget was easy to communicate with and got back to me immediately when I had any questions.

Best part is Three Bags Full just a 2 minute walk away which has great coffee + brunch. "

74548,8636158,2013-11-10,7319326,William,91,"In November 2013 I stayed at Mario's place for two days, booked through airbnb.com .

Location & Access:  The location could not be better.  The Milano Apartments is in the middle of the central business district of Melbourne.  It is opposite the Royal Melbourne Institute of Technology and one block from the Queen Victoria Market.  A big supermarket is right next door.  There are dozens and dozens of cafe, bars and restaurants nearby.  The Bourke Street Mall with the two leading Department Stores in Australia is about four blocks away.  One of the staff members at Milano Apartments was most helpful with shopping information.  

The SkyBus runs from the airport to Southern Cross Station from which a 'hotel transfer service' takes you to your hotel, included.  This is a much smaller bus and people with bigger bags might have an issue.  

Facilities.  Mario's place is on the 18th floor.  What was available to me was a bedroom and a private ensuite bathroom.  The place is very, very clean.  I had a twin bed.  Mario supplies huge bathsheets which are 1.5 m long and thick as a blanket.  He also makes the kitchen and living room available to me.  Internet is available next door at Captain Melville's bar and a McDonald's a block away.  The gym and pool are on the 7th floor.  The gym's set of weight machines is adequate but not great.  

The Host:  Mario is a great host.  He has information and advice if you want it.  Or he will leave you alone.  He is also a good conversationalist.  Mario let me check in at 10 am which was much appreciated, having flown overnight from Hong Kong.

Welcome access to kitchen and an extra fridge so there's plenty of space. Nice quiet street, an easy walk to the train to get into CBD. 

There are kids, so it's not a silent mountain retreat, but speaking as a person who prefers things very quiet I had no issues at all.

*** SIMPLY THE BEST is HODGSON HOUSE  in MELBOURNE WITH ALAN  ***

So, albeit being ill since I returned to Paris, I firmly wanted to let my eulogistic comment here about how delightful was the journey I spent at Alan‚Äôs home in Melbourne ; and to consequently rightly recommend it here on Airbnb.

It was indeed, for many reasons, the best time I‚Äôve been living in Melbourne (and I‚Äôm someone very exacting).
Well, first, because there is the charm of FITZROY, of course  : a creative artistic place which is a true enchantment !
Then,  (and above all) because there is the gentle elegance of mind, the intelligence, and the fair kindness so alive into Alan‚Äôs words &   behaviour.  

*** Such a human of great quality of soul :
 and I feel proud and very grateful now to have met him and to have been enlightened by his worthy Wisdom ! ***


Yet to make short I should simply say that his home was perfect ; and that Alan is indeed an excellent host ---full of Art & Heart---.


 (Website hidden by Airbnb) Besides, that is wonderful how poetry is breathing everywhere at the Hodgson House !

---Truly BEAUTIFUL  !---

And being so good, this place could seem to be a dream ;  so, I will have to describe better and tell you more about it.

*** Thus, each room is more than comfortable but also peaceful and full of art at Alan‚Äôs place ; and from the food to the bed as well as from the plants to the pets, (Jack and Amy so sweet!),  & so on :  all is life, alive, ---ideal---, and so lovely ! ***

And furthermore, in his unforgettable ‚ÄúGarden of Delights‚Äù, we spend the most pleasant moments between fruit trees, flowers, fishes, beauties ‚Ä¶ and butterflies.

      So, by Alan‚Äôs delicacy and by all the Quality of the Beings, everything is meant to feel very happy there when we come to his lovely place.

 (Website hidden by Airbnb) ***Well, this was just HEAVEN on earth.***

***

Otherwise (more personally), I want to THANK YOU, INFINITELY, Alan, to have received me so sweetly ! 
(You  are an angel, Alan ; as your home is a paradise.)

 I will never forget   (not such as the kea: so sorry about that!)  ;  and, for sure,  from Melbourne, I lived the best memories there.  

Consequently,  from the depth of my heart I wish many *lovely good* people could also come to meet you, Alan, in order to give ---during the time of their trip (their life)  by your contact and by your home---,  pleasures for awhile to their bodies, joy to their mind, and delight to their soul.

Thank you.
Yours, Yasmina.---

If our schedule had given us more time to stay, there would have been plenty to do with the many books and DVD's, or just chill out and have a chat with Sharyn in the living room and play with Roger the dog!

We would definitely stay again given the chance, and recommend to our friends!"

108032,113984094,2016-11-14,15696786,Ying,88,"Malcolm's place is lovely and the location is perfect if you would like to explore the city. It's walkable to almost anything in the city, and failing that, you always have the Melbourne trams.

Checkin/checkout was a breeze and Malcolm was helpful throughout our stay. Malcolm doesn't have a washing machine though, so if you're staying long, the nearest coin laundromat is located just opposite Queen Vic Market.  

We drove, so parking was a bit of a pain though in the city and quite dear. But we knew that before we arrived so it's just a hassle moving the car around the city for the most optimal parking spots. If you're staying in the city mostly, ditch the car - there are other options such as Uber and public transport that can take you to most places around the area without costing you an arm and a leg.  

Thanks again Malcolm!  "

Colin has given a lot of information which can best do in and around Melbourne and how to get there. 
The room is very large with a private bathroom. The room faces the street and has a balcony, but one doesn¬¥t hear something from the street. My sleep there was very well. The bed was very comfortable and everything neat and clean. The neighborhood in St. Kilda is nice too, it¬¥s only about 15 minutes away from the beach. Supermarkets, laundry rooms and restaurants are also nearby. And it takes only a few minutes to walk to the tram to the central city which needs about an half hour.

It's not fancy, but really just feels like you're a welcome guest in someone's home, with full privacy - it was perfect for my two nights."

51592,95158803,2016-08-18,86592202,Zach,93,Had a really nice stay overall. Location was the highlight with lots of options nearby. Neighboring bagel place ended up being my coffee supplier for the trip. Apartment had everything I needed and the view of the city was amazing.
297350,233269754,2018-02-08,148143225,Zachary,100,Ryan and Rhiannon have a lovely home in a quiet neighbourhood. Their hospitality went above and beyond expectations and they provided fantastic local tips. Highly recommended.
297350,212224505,2017-11-16,101479051,Zain,100,"Ryan and Rhiannon were amazing hosts, and they answered all our questions and then some. Very hospitable, and they give you plenty of space and freedom. We ended up binge watching MindHunter together with them. Their dog Romeo is very well behaved and really friendly and cute. The room itself was nice, clean and well equipped, and so was the kitchen. The appliances, amenities and creature comforts were top notch, and our week flew by faster than we realised. Would definitely recommend, and would definitely stay again."

When I first arrived at the airport on Wed, 7th Dec, I got sick due to jet lag, lack of water and lack of sleep through the 8 hour trip. I managed to drive to her house with  the help of the gps . I greeted her and we talked about the room she had reserved for me. Then I felt dizzy, vomitted and had to ask her help to send me to the clinic.  So she drove me to a local hospital and then to a local pharmacy. 
After checking my BP at the pharmacy , I realized that I needed the rest. I was really grateful and thankful to her that she left her work and helped me even though her own daughter who happened to be ill needed her attention the most . She was at home most of the time and was always ready to provide me advice on my trips to town.
I find her to be  very friendly, helpful and a very responsible host.

The room is very comfortable . Apart from the first day, my trip around Melbourne and nearby attraction places was very good and I managed to to fulfill all my earlier expectations.  

The house is just 3 minutes from the West Gate Bridge which allows us to reach Melbourne city in less than 15 minutes. The city is very lively and beautiful , very clean with a mix of  skyscrapers and historical landmarks as well.  It has a good transportation system and offers plenty of attractions and  variety of  shops  selling famous brands . 

I considered my trip a success and the way the host treated me contributed greatly to that . If I have the opportunity to come back again in the future , I definitely would love to stay at her place again.  

Thank you Karen , Jim, Bella and Austin for the great stay at your place.

Cheers
Zack

We had a tight schedule in Melbourne, but Sharyn is extremely nice and helpful. The construction is going on, but if you are out during day time, it is not a problem at all. "

257915,75732993,2016-05-22,54969834,Zhixing,0,"Apartment is very close to Crown and minutes drive to various attraction in Melbourne. The host was very helpful in arranging the keys collection at check in, although we arrived at 10.30pm instead of 8pm as agreed. The rooms look dull due to the colours of the curtains and carpet used, but are decently maintained for a travelling group, save for a broken window latch which resulted in the window not being able to close tightly. Overall still a pleasant experience."
